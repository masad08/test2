Monitoring 
and 
ensuring 
the 
integrity 
of 
data 
within 
the 
clinical 
trial 
process 
is 
currently 
not 
always 
feasible 
with 
the 
current 
research 
system. 
We 
propose 
a 
blockchain-based 
system 
to 
make 
data 
collected 
in 
the 
clinical 
trial 
process 
immutable, 
traceable, 
and 
potentially 
more 
trustworthy. 
We 
use 
raw 
data 
from 
a 
real 
completed 
clinical 
trial, 
simulate 
the 
trial 
onto 
a 
proof 
of 
concept 
web 
portal 
service, 
and 
test 
its 
resilience 
to 
data 
tampering. 
We 
also 
assess 
its 
prospects 
to 
provide 
a 
traceable 
and 
useful 
audit 
trail 
of 
trial 
data 
for 
regulators, 
and 
a 
flexible 
service 
for 
all 
members 
within 
the 
clinical 
trials 
network. 
We 
also 
improve 
the 
way 
adverse 
events 
are 
currently 
reported. 
In 
conclusion, 
we 
advocate 
that 
this 
service 
could 
offer 
an 
improvement 
in 
clinical 
trial 
data 
management, 
and 
could 
bolster 
trust 
in 
the 
clinical 
research 
process 
and 
the 
ease 
at 
which 
regulators 
can 
oversee 
trials.

linical 
trial 
networks 
often 
involve 
many 
parties 
and 
sites, 
and 
a 
large 
flow 
of 
information 
and 
confidential 
data. 
With 
the 
involvement 
of 
more 
parties, 
more 
exchanges, 
and 
trials 
being 
conducted 
far 
from 
sponsoring 
institutions 
comes 
the 
opportunity 
for 
human-induced 
error, 
whether 
it 
is 
unintentional 
or 
malicious. 
In 
a 
survey 
of 
authors 
of 
clinical 
drug 
trials, 
17% 
of 
them 
reported 
that 
they 
were 
personally 
aware 
of 
intentional 
fabrication 
in 
research1. 
Although 
it 
is 
obviously 
not 
possible 
to 
calculate 
the 
actual 
rate 
or 
impact 
of 
fraud, 
there 
is 
evidence 
that 
some 
misconduct 
and 
alteration 
of 
data 
is 
happening 
in 
scientific 
and 
medical 
research2, 
potentially 
including 
clinical 
trials. 
In 
addition, 
current 
clinical 
trials 
are 
executed 
with 
many 
manual 
processes 
that 
could 
be 
prone 
to 
error. 
Enforcing 
Good 
Clinical 
Practice 
guidelines 
set 
forth 
by 
the 
International 
Council 
for 
Harmonization 
of 
Requirements 
for 
Pharmaceuticals 
for 
Human 
Use 
(ICH) 
has 
been 
a 
challenge 
for 
regulators 
of 
trials, 
and 
process 
improvement 
is 
an 
active 
area 
of 
research3. 
For 
regulators 
of 
trials 
such 
as 
the 
Food 
and 
Drug 
Administration 
(FDA), 
auditing 
of 
data 
are 
challenging, 
and 
real-time 
oversight 
of 
a 
trial 
is 
lacking 
as 
there 
is 
no 
easy 
and 
secure 
way 
of 
accessing 
or 
viewing 
the 
complex 
network 
of 
data 
transactions 
as 
they 
occur. 
There 
can 
be 
a 
lack 
of 
transparency 
and 
traceability 
of 
data, 
lack 
of 
real-time 
access 
to 
results 
as 
they 
are 
made, 
and 
potentially 
a 
risk 
of 
data 
tampering3. 
The 
ability 
to 
easily 
trace 
data 
back 
to 
the 
original 
source 
can 
be 
limited4, 
and 
the 
FDA 
has 
identified 
this 
lack 
of 
traceability 
as 
one 
of 
their 
top 
data 
issues 
to 
address5. 


Blockchain 
is 
a 
new 
software 
development 
methodology 
involving 
a 
unique 
data 
structure 
that 
has 
garnered 
increased 
attention 
due 
to 
the 
seminal 
paper 
that 
outlined 
Bitcoin 
(bitcoin. 
org)6. 
The 
technology 
provides 
a 
data 
structure 
that 
ensure 
a 
secure 
and 
unfalsifiable 
transaction 
history. 
This 
is 
accomplished 
primarily 
through 
the 
use 
of 
cryptographic 
hashing, 
which 
has 
properties 
and 
use 
cases 
in 
many 
domains 
ranging 
from 
internet 
security 
to 
banking. 
A 
hash 
function 
is 
a 
function 
that 
maps 
data 
of 
variable 
length 
data 
to 
a 
fixed-length 
digest. 
Any 
change 
to 
the 
input 
data 
result 
in 
an 
unpredictable 
change 
in 
the 
hash. 
In 
this 
implementation, 
each 
new 
block 
added 
to 
the 
chain 
includes 
a 
hash 
of 
the 
previous 
block. 
If 
the 
previous 
block 
is 
later 
changed, 
the 
subsequent 
hash 
would 
no 
longer 
be 
valid. 
In 
addition, 
blockchains 
are 
designed 
to 
be 
append 
only, 
and 
are 
thus 
immutable 
by 
design, 
providing 
a 
guarantee 
of 
safeguarded 
data. 
This 
yields 
a 
verifiable 
and 
tamper 
proof 
history 
of 
all 
transactions 
since 
its 
beginning6. 


We 
propose 
a 
solution 
to 
the 
challenges 
in 
the 
current 
clinical 
trials 
system 
by 
using 
blockchain 
technology, 
coupled 
with 
changes 
in 
methodology 
for 
the 
management 
of 
clinical 
trials. 
Due 
to 
the 
innate 
need 
of 
clinical 
trials 
to 
have 
a 
centralized 
authority, 
such 
as 
through 
the 
regulator, 
a 
completely 
decentralized 
blockchain 
infrastructure 
as 
used 
in 
Bitcoin 
might 
not 
be 
appropriate. 
Instead, 
we 
borrow 
ideas 
and 
repurpose 
the 
methodology 
to 
work 
with 
clinical 
trial 
management, 
and 
demonstrate 
the 
feasibility 
with 
a 
new 
prototype 
web 
portal. 
Blockchain 
has 
already 
been 
proposed 
for 
use 
in 
various 
healthcare 
settings7, 
with 
potential 
applications 
in 
medical 
record 
management, 
claims 
processing, 
health 
supply 
chain 
management, 
and 
integration 
of 
geospatial 
data 
in 
various 
data 
modalities8. 
Work 
has 
already 
begun 
in 
seeing 
how 
clinical 
trial 
management 
can 
be 
improved 
with 
blockchain 
technologies9,10. 
Moreover, 
certain 
aspects 
relevant 
to 
the 
clinical 
trial 
process, 
such 
as 
patient 
recruiting 
and 
IRB 
(Institutional 
Review 
Board) 
enforcement 
of 
human 
subject 
regulations 
via 
smart 
contracts, 
have 
been 
described 
at 
a 
high 
level 
in 
the 
literature11. 
We 
improve 
upon 
previous 
work 
by 
implementing 
a 
web-based 
portal 
accessible 
to 
all 
parties 
with 
a 
real 
clinical 
trial 
dataset, 
facilitating 
and 
verifying 
patient 
and 
clinical 
investigator 
interaction, 
integrating 
version 
control 
into 


the 
blockchain, 
expediting 
adverse 
event 
reporting, 
and 
testing 
malicious 
attacks 
to 
data 
integrity 
with 
real 
world 
clinical 
data. 


Results 


Network 
protocol. 
We 
modeled 
a 
prototype 
phase 
II 
clinical 
trial. 
Upon 
approval 
of 
the 
study 
protocol 
and 
initiation 
of 
phase 
II, 
we 
propose 
a 
future 
regulator 
could 
instantiate 
a 
private 
blockchain 
and 
registers 
all 
participating 
parties 
in 
the 
portal 
providing 
authenticated 
and 
controlled 
web-based 
and 
API 
(application 
programming 
interface) 
access 
to 
the 
blockchain. 
All 
parties 
would 
be 
required 
to 
use 
the 
portal 
service 
for 
any 
and 
all 
exchange 
of 
information 
related 
to 
the 
trial, 
and 
only 
the 
information 
present 
on 
the 
blockchain 
would 
be 
used 
for 
review 
when 
considering 
approval 
of 
the 
treatment. 
The 
network 
and 
representative 
transactions 
are 
illustrated 
in 
Fig. 
1. 


For 
new 
patient 
recruitment 
and 
consent 
acquisition 
by 
the 
clinical 
site, 
we 
propose 
that 
an 
Interactive 
Voice 
Response 
System 
(IVRS) 
generates 
unique 
verification 
codes 
for 
each 
subject 
to 
give 
to 
the 
trial 
investigator 
at 
the 
clinical 
site, 
and 
posts 
encrypted 
decoding 
keys 
for 
later 
unblinding. 
The 
decoding 
keys 
describe 
the 
various 
treatment 
types 
that 
a 
patient 
can 
receive, 
and 
will 
be 
saved 
in 
a 
password 
protected 
environment 
by 
the 
IVRS 
service 
provider. 
The 
trial 
sponsor 
then 
sends 
a 
blinded 
treatment 
distribution 
scheme 
to 
the 
trial 
investigator 
at 
the 
clinical 
site. 
The 
unique 
verification 
codes 
for 
each 
subject 
are 
appended 
to 
that 
subject’s 
CRF 
at 
the 
clinical 
site 
upon 
the 
office 
visit. 
All 
CRFs 
would 
be 
completed 
digitally 
and 
considered 
valid 
if 
the 
proper 
verification 
code 
is 
present. 
Once 
completed, 
the 
CRF 
will 
be 
directed 
to 
the 
Clinical 
Research 
Organization 
(CRO) 
involved 
in 
the 
trial, 
and 
this 
transaction 
will 
be 
stamped 
onto 
the 
growing 
blockchain. 


When 
adverse 
events 
are 
reported, 
we 
envision 
the 
Data 
Safety 
Management 
Board 
(DSMB) 
or 
regulatory 
agency 
would 
be 
able 
to 
continuously 
see 
these 
events 
through 
each 
chain-posted 
CRF, 
and 
then 
potentially 
propagate 
these 
onto 
that 
trial’s 
page 
for 
public 
view, 
if 
appropriate. 
Once 
the 
CRO 
receives 
raw 
CRF 
data, 
data 
cleaning, 
and 
statistical 
analysis 
can 
begin 
and 
be 
done 
transparently. 
Upon 
completion, 
cleaned 
data 
and 
analysis 
scripts 
are 
sent 
to 
the 
trial 
sponsor 
through 
the 
portal 
and 
these 
transactions 
are 
subsequently 
recorded 
onto 
the 
blockchain. 
Any 
outside 
data 
collection 
sources 
that 
are 
enrolled 
in 
the 
clinical 
trial 
would 
also 
have 
to 
send 
data 
to 
the 
sponsor 
through 
the 
portal, 
all 
marked 
on 
the 
growing 
ledger. 


When 
the 
trial 
sponsor 
wishes 
to 
apply 
for 
approval 
of 
the 
drug, 
the 
sponsor 
would 
send 
all 
of 
their 
finalized 
data 
and 
in 
house 
statistical 
analysis 
results 
to 
the 
regulator 
through 
the 
portal 
and 
these, 
like 
all 
other 
elements, 
would 
be 
subsequently 
added 
to 
the 
chain. 
When 
reviewing 
for 
approval, 
the 
regulator 
will 
only 
consider 
data 
that 
are 
present 
on 
this 
secure 
blockchain, 
and 
has 
full 
read 
access 
to 
everything 
that 
has 
occurred 
since 
the 
blockchain’s 
instantiation. 
All 
data 
that 
were 
ever 
transmitted 
in 
the 
network 
would 
be 
easily 
accessible, 
and 
its 
integrity 
and 
guarantee 
of 
when 
the 
transaction 
occurred 
will 
be 
assured. 


Data 
transaction 
details. 
Whenever 
a 
transaction 
occurs, 
the 
sender, 
receiver, 
timestamp, 
file 
attachment, 
and 
hash 
of 
the 
previous 
block, 
are 
all 
recorded 
onto 
a 
new 
block. 
These 
elements 
are 
then 
concatenated 
together, 
and 
hashed 
using 
the 
SHA256 
algorithm12, 
with 
the 
result 
instantiated 
as 
the 
hash 
string 
of 
the 
current 
block. 
The 
blockchain 
is 
constructed 
by 
creating 
a 
linked 
list 
of 
such 
blocks 
(Fig. 
2). 
The 
previous 
block’s 
hash 
is 
kept 
for 
ordering 
and 
to 
make 
each 
block 
dependent 
on 
all 
blocks 
that 
preceded 
it 
in 
the 
chain, 
which 
is 
a 
useful 
property 
for 
quickly 
validating 
a 
chain6. 
Data 
storage 
of 
the 
blockchain 
will 
be 
accomplished 
by 
duplicating 
and 
distributing 
the 
chain 
to

(boxed) 
within 
a 
clinical

are 
shown 


physically 
separate

and

warehouses 
to 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
regulator 
(see 
Supplementary 
Methods). 


Encryption 
through 
a 
password 
based 
key 
derivation 
function 
is 
offered, 
and 
can 
ensure 
that 
sensitive 
information 
is 
protected 
if 
the 
user 
chooses 
to 
do 
so, 
which 
is 
especially 
relevant 
to 
maintaining 
integrity 
of 
health 
and 
medical 
information, 
and 
eliminating 
information 
exposure 
to 
unwanted 
parties. 
Data 
are 
thus 
stored 
as 
an 
unintelligible 
series 
of 
bytes 
at 
the 
storage 
level, 
ensuring 
that 
any 
sensitive 
information 
in 
the 
network 
is 
obfuscated 
and 
will 
not 
be 
compromised 
in 
the 
incident 
of 
a 
data 
breach. 


File 
storage 
of 
any 
type 
onto 
the 
blockchain 
is 
supported, 
and 
the 
user 
is 
able 
to 
encrypt, 
send, 
and 
extract 
files 
easily. 
For 
regulators, 
the 
full 
transaction 
history 
since 
the 
block’s 
genesis 
is 
readily 
available 
with 
precise 
timestamps 
(Fig. 
3a), 
and 
the 
auditing 
process 
can 
be 
done 
swiftly 
and 
with 
the 
confidence 
that 
all 
data 
are 
original 
or 
version 
controlled. 
Content 
since 
the 
earliest 
phases 
of 
the 
trial 
are 
sorted, 
fully 
transparent, 
and 
easily 
compressible, 
and 
downloadable. 


Version 
controls. 
If 
a 
user 
needs 
to 
edit 
content 
that 
is 
already 
present 
on 
the 
blockchain, 
such 
as 
the 
case 
when 
an 
honest 
mistake 
is 
made 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
corrected, 
the 
user 
could 
make 
an 
update 
known 
by 
submitting 
a 
new 
transaction 
with 
the 
corrected 
data 
without 
overwriting 
the 
old 
data. 
By 
nature, 
blockchains 
are 
append 
only, 
so 
editing 
the 
data 
directly 
on 
the 
blockchain 
is 
not 
possible. 
We 
propose 
combining 
blockchain’s 
append 
only 
criteria 
with 
version 
controlling 
similar 
to 
the 
functionality 
of 
GitHub 
to 
accommodate 
this 
issue. 
When 
a 
new 
file 
is 
uploaded 
in 
a 
transaction, 
its 
contents 
are 
hashed 
and 
compared 
to 
any 
existing 
files 
on 
the 
blockchain. 
If 
there 
is 
a 
conflict, 
then 
the 
system 
initiates 
a 
schema 
in 
which 
subsequent 


and 
differing 
versions 
of 
a 
file 
are 
given 
incrementing 
version 
numbers 
automatically. 
Hence, 
a 
user 
can 
be 
assured 
that 
any 
downstream 
modifications

Simulation 
of 
a 
previously 
completed 
clinical 
trial. 
To 
test 
how 
blockchain 
software 
technologies 
could 
be 
used 
to 
manage 
the 
governance 
and 
data 
management 
aspects 
of 
a 
clinical 
trial, 
we 
simulated 
how 
a 
previously 
completed 
clinical 
trial 
testing 
the 
efficacy 
and 
safety 
of 
omalizumab13 
could 
have 
been 
executed 
using 
blockchain. 
We 
downloaded 
the 
completed 
clinical 
trials 
data, 
including 
all 
necessary 
components, 
such 
as 
raw 
data, 
case 
report 
form 
(CRF) 
components, 
and 
protocols 
from 
the 
open 
clinical 
trials 
data 
repository 
ImmPort14 
(see 
Data 
Availability). 
The 
trial 
simulation 
sequence 
of 
events 
and 
corresponding 
files 
are 
shown 
in 
Fig. 
2. 
Of 
the 
159 
actual 
patients 
in 
the 
trial 
with 
CRF 
data, 
we 
mimicked 
one 
subject 
from 
each 
of 
the 
four 
treatment 
arms 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
clarity. 
Only 
a 
few 
selected 
categories 
from 
the 
large 
wealth 
of 
CRF 
information 
were 
mirrored 
for 
the 
same 
reason 
(see 
Methods). 
The 
statistical 
scripts 
in 
this 
simulation 
are 
not 
the 
real 
Python 
analyses 
because 
of 
our 
lack 
of 
access. 


Here, 
we 
show 
a 
simulation 
of 
how 
different 
types 
of 
clinical 
trial 
events 
were 
implemented 
using 
our 
blockchain-based 
data 
portal. 
The 
first 
event 
occurs 
during 
encounters 
between 
a 
clinical 
investigator 
and 
the 
patients 
after 
being 
enrolled 
for 
a 
clinical 
trial. 
The 
second 
event 
we 
simulated 
is 
the 
mutation 
of 
CRF 
data 
by 
the

sponsor. 
The 
third 
event 
is

The 
growing 
blockchain. 
With 
each 
new 
transaction 
that 
occurs, 
a 
block 
is 
appended 
and 
keeps 
track 
of 
information 
like 
the 
timestamp, 
sender, 
receiver, 
file 
contents, 
hash 
of 
the 
previous 
block, 
and 
current 
hash, 
all 
in 
an 
immutable 
data 
structure. 
On-chain 
storage 
of 
such 
elements 
requires 
minimal 
memory 
allocation 
linearly 
proportional 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
data 
being 
uploaded, 
since 
the 
additional 
book 
keeping 
elements 
are 
fixed-length 
strings. 
Hence 
scalability 
is 
possible, 
especially 
given 
adequate 
allocation 
of 
hardware 
made 
possible 
via 
growing 
cloud 
storage 
capabilities 
(see 
Supplementary 
Discussion). 
A 
summary, 
compressed 
blockchain 
is 
shown. 
The 
actual 
blockchain 
will 
have 
a 
beginning 
genesis 
block 
and 
individual 
blocks 
for 
each 
transaction 
(such 
as 
a 
new 
block 
for 
each 
CRF 
instead 
of 
a 
single 
block 
for 
all 
CRFs 
as 
shown). 
The 
compressed 
chain 
is 
shown 
to 
illustrate 
the 
chronology 
of 
the 
trial, 
and 
what 
information 
constitutes 
a 
block 


on 
the 
machine 
housing 
the 
data. 
Finally, 
we 
demonstrate 
an 
improved 
and 
expedited 
version 
of 
adverse 
event 
reporting. 


Patient 
and 
clinical 
investigator 
encounters. 
We 
composed 
truncated 
and 
digitized 
CRFs 
for 
the 
four 
patients 
we 
mimicked 
on 
the 
portal 
using 
the 
publicly 
available 
CRF 
component 
data. 
For 
instance, 
Subject 
73,491 
from 
the 
study 
came 
to 
the 
clinical 
site 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
the 
trial 
period 
(day 
0). 
The 
investigator 
collected 
immunological 
data, 
such 
as 
a 
white 
blood 
cell 
concentration 
of 
5.9 
× 
103 
cells 
per 
μL, 
eosinophil 
percentage 
of 
4.6%, 
and 
platelet 
count 
of 
223 
× 
103 
cells 
per 
μL 
(Supplementary 
Note 
1). 
In 
our 
proposed 
schema, 
if 
the 
CRF 
were 
paper 
based, 
then 
it 
would 
be 
scanned 
in; 
if 
electronically 
captured, 
it 
would 
be 
directly 
added 
to 
the 
growing 
blockchain 
via 
the 
portal, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
our 
simulation. 
Verification 
codes 
are 
appended 
to 
each 
CRF. 


User 
mediated 
corruption. 
We 
then 
simulated 
two 
types 
of 
hostile 
conditions 
for 
the 
trial. 
The 
first 
was 
to 
simulate 
an 
effort 
to 
manipulate 
data 
that 
were 
uploaded 
from 
other 
trial 
staff. 
While 
logged 
in 
as 
the 
trial 
sponsor, 
we 
attempted 
to 
modify 
the 
adverse 
events 
reported 
in 
selected 
CRFs 
that 
recorded 
subjects 
73,491 
and 
73,511 
receiving 
the 
treatment 
drug 
omalizumab 
so 
as 
to 
deceptively 
bolster 
treatment 
approval 
in 
a 
potentially 
untrustworthy 
network. 
Subject 
73,491 
showed 
many 
adverse 
reactions 
during 
the 
treatment 
period, 
such 
as 
muscle 
strain, 
injection 
site 
swelling, 
sinus 
headaches, 
and 
nasal 
congestion 
among 
other 
events 
(Supplementary 
Note 
1), 
while 
Subject 
73,511 
exhibited 
events 
such 
as 
chest 
tightness, 
injection 
site 


reactions, 
sinus 
congestion, 
decreased 
blood 
pressure, 
and 
a 
lower 
respiratory 
tract 
infection 
among 
other 
ill 
effects 
(Supplementary 
Note 
2). 
As 
the 
trial 
sponsor, 
these 
CRFs 
were 
mutated 
such 
that 
no 
adverse 
events 
were 
listed 
(Supplementary 
Note 
3, 
4). 
The 
new 
tampered 
replacement 
files 
are 
appended 
with 
a 
version 
number 
automatically 
(Fig. 
3b), 
and 
the 
corrupting 
party, 
time 
of 
modification, 
and 
changes 
are 
all 
easily 
visible. 
The 
system 
is 
capable 
of 
handling 
multiple 
versions 
of 
files 
in 
case 
the 
original 
one 
is 
part 
of 
a 
later 
transaction, 
or 
in 
case 
further 
revisions 
or 
illegitimate 
mutations 
are 
made. 
These 
are 
designated 
with 
incrementing 
version 
numbers 
for 
each 
new 
unique 
version. 
Original 
documents, 
however, 
are 
designated 
with 
no 
version 
number. 


With 
an 
append 
only 
transaction 
scheme 
and 
version 
controlling, 
we 
have 
a 
means 
of 
keeping 
a 
full 
record 
of 
everything 
that 
happens 
to 
a 
file, 
and 
can 
easily 
refer 
to 
the 
author 
and 
old 
and 
new 
versions 
of 
data, 
similar 
to 
the 
concept 
and 
flexibility 
of 
GitHub. 
This 
is 
integral 
to 
the 
auditing 
process 
as 
regulators 
can 
track 
precisely 
what 
was 
changed, 
by 
whom, 
and 
when 
with 
the 
immutable 
timestamp. 
Hence, 
we 
simultaneously 
accommodate 
the 
user’s 
need 
for 
making 
changes 
clear, 
the 
regulator’s 
desire 
for 
monitoring 
data 
easily, 
and 
also 
abide 
by 
blockchain’s

which 
allows 
for

of

would 
detect 
and 
guard 
against 
such 
changes. 
In 
the 
blockchain 
ledger 
section 
of 
the 
portal, 
there 
is 
a 
validation 
check 
that 
successfully 
shows 
exactly 
where 
the 
fault 
and 
corrupted 
file 
lies 
(Fig. 
3c). 
Due 
to 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
a 
hash 
function’s 
output 
in 
relation 
to 
its 
input, 
changing 
the 
data 
in 
even 
the 
smallest 
way 
in 
a 
block, 
such 
as 
modifying 
a 
single 
character 
in 
the 
block’s 
attached 
file, 
will 
result 
in 
a 
completely 
different 
hash 
string. 
This 
string 
will 
be 
fed 
into 
the 
input 
of 
the 
next 
block’s 
hash 
function, 
and 
the 
resulting 
string 
will 
be 
completely 
different 
from 
what 
it 
was 
prior 
to 
the 
data 
modification. 
Hence, 
data 
integrity 
can 
be 
checked 
by 
simply 
comparing 
the 
hash 
strings 
of 
a 
proposed 
blockchain 
under 
audit 
with 
a 
set 
of 
verified 
and 
correct 
hashes. 
Since 
each 
transaction 
is 
given 
its 
own 
block, 
precise 
determination 
of 
location 
and 
file 
that 
were 
corrupted 
are 
possible 
by 
simply 
finding 
the 
first 
block 
with 
an 
incorrect 
hash. 
Hence, 
storage 
of 
the 
desired 
and 
correct 
hashes 
is 
necessary, 
and 
we 
advocate 
for 
centralized 
and 
secured 
storage 
by 
the 
trusted 
regulator 
who 
will 
be 
performing 
the 
audit 
(see 
Supplementary 
Methods). 
Since 
only 
hash 
strings 
are 
required 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
verifying 
integrity, 
the 
regulator 
need 
not 
allocate 
much 
hard 
disk 
space 
for 
the 
audit 
process. 
Verifying 
integrity 
can 
be 
done 
quickly 
as 
the 
regulator 
need 
only 
check 
for 
string 
equivalence, 
which 
is 
a 
quick 
and 
trivial 
process. 


Zero-knowledge 
proof 
of 
purity. 
In 
this 
proof 
of 
concept 
model, 
we 
illustrate 
the 
ease 
at 
which 
a 
data 
repository 
can 
be 
checked 
and 
verified 
for 
tampering 
without 
manually 
reviewing 
each 
file. 
SHA256 
hashing 
is 
a 
quick 
and 
highly 
optimized 
process12, 
and 
comparing 
two 
hash 
string 
for 
equality 
is 
trivial. 
Hence, 
verifying 
originality 
can 
be 
done 
quickly, 
and 
without 
actually 
opening 
and 
inspecting 
data, 
which 
is 
useful 
if 
confidential 
data 
are 
being 
audited. 
This 
serves 
as 
a 
zero-knowledge 
proof15 
of 
data 
integrity 
because 
the 
auditor 
need 
not 
know 
the 
exact 
configurations 
and 
detailed 
information 
within 
a 
file, 
and 
yet 
still 
verify 
its 
originality. 
This 
is 
particularly 
useful 
for 
the 
data 
being 
handled 
in 
clinical 
processes. 
This 
type 
of 
methodology 
and 
proof 
provides 
another 
layer 
of 
security 
and 
respect 
for 
confidential 
data, 
all 
while 
quickly 
and 
automatically 
verifying 
purity 
of 
data. 
Furthermore, 
by 
giving 
the 
user 
the 
option 
of 
storing 
encrypted 
data 
on 
the 
servers, 
we 
ensure 
that 
sensitive 
information 
cannot 
be 
compromised 
even 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
data 
breach. 


Expedited 
adverse 
event 
reporting. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
simulation 
in 
the 
portal, 
we 
also 
scrutinized 
adverse 
event 
reporting 
and 
how 
to 
improve 
it. 
In 
abidance 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
making 
the 
management 
of 
a 
clinical 
trial 
easier 
and 
more 
effective 
than 
the 
current 
standard, 
adverse 
events 
from 
the 
clinical 
investigator 
uploaded 
CRFs 
are 
automatically 
parsed 
and 
populated 
to 
the 
pages 
of 
the 
regulator 
and 
DSMB 
(Fig. 
3d). 
This 
not 
only 
serves 
as 
a 
fast 
means 
of 
assessing 
safety 
as 
the 
trial 
continues, 
but 
also 
circumvents 
the 
slower 
and 
potentially 
error 
prone 
route 
that 
adverse 
event 
reporting 
would 
normally 
take 
before 
reaching 
the 
regulator. 
In 
the 
current 
way 
clinical 
trials 
are 
run, 
the 
CRFs 
would 
normally 
be 
sent 
to 
the 
CRO, 
who 
then 
parses 
out 
the 
adverse 
reactions 
and 
reports 
these 
events 
to 
the 
sponsor, 
who 
sends 
these 
reports 
to 
the 
DSMB. 
This 
process 
takes 
time, 
and 
is 
subject 
to 
modification 
or 
loss 
by 
human 
error 
or 
malice. 
In 
the 
proposed 
scheme 
and 
proof 
of 
concept 
service, 
this 
vulnerable 
process 
is 
circumvented, 
and 
the 
regulator 
or 
DSMB 
can 
be 
immediately 
notified 
of 
each 
subject’s 
adverse 
reactions 
at 
the 
soonest 
possible 
time, 
which 
can 
be 
crucial 
for 
maintaining 
public 
safety. 
Since 
the 
adverse 
events 
are 
extracted 
directly 
from 
the 
CRFs 
on 
the 
immutable 
blockchain, 
the 
regulator 
and 
DSMB 
can 
be 
assured 
that 
the 
events 
are 
legitimate. 


Discussion 


Blockchain 
architecture 
has 
been 
prescribed 
to 
cure 
many 
data 
interoperability 
challenges 
today, 
including 
tasks 
such 
as 
overturning 
the 
current 
financial 
system6 
and 
remodeling 
the 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
internet16. 
Many 
of 
these 
proposed 
solutions 
are 
either 
not 
realistic, 
or 
have 
not 
yet 
demonstrated 
efficacy. 
Here, 
we 
showed 
that 
a 
blockchain-based 
file 
and 
data 
structure 
could 
be 
used 
to 
reliably 
safeguard 
data 
in 
a 
clinical 
trials 
network, 
and 
provide 
an 
immutable 
and 
fully 
traceable 
audit 
trail. 
Scalability 
is 
of 
utmost 
importance 
when 
considering 
the 
utility 
of 
such 
an 
architecture, 
especially 
if 
it 
were 
to 
move 
to 
full-scale 
production 
from 
proof 
of 
concept. 
The 
system 
scales 
linearly 
in 
regards 
to 
memory 
allocation. 
Similarly, 
performance 
is 
also 
linear 
in 
dataset 
size, 
so 
the 
architecture 
is 
able 
to 
scale 
well 
(for 
formal 
discussion, 
see 
Supplementary 
Discussion). 


By 
using 
the 
actual 
clinical 
trials 
data 
from 
a 
previously 
completed 
major 
clinical 
study, 
Efficacy 
and 
Safety 
Evaluation 
of 
Allergen 
Immunotherapy 
Co-Administered 
with 
Omalizumab, 
we 
showed 
that 
data 
entry, 
storage, 
and 
adverse 
event 
reporting 
can 
be 
performed 
in 
a 
more 
robust 
and 
secure 
manner, 
which 
could 
withstand 
attacks 
from 
both 
other 
people 
in 
the 
network 
and 
infrastructure 
damage 
at 
the 
storage 
level. 


We 
do 
see 
some 
limitations 
in 
this 
work. 
Forcing 
all 
participating 
parties 
to 
use 
a 
service 
like 
this 
will 
still 
remain 
a 
challenge. 
This 
could 
be 
overcome 
by 
restricting 
regulatory 
approval 
of 
a 
proposed 
treatment 
upon 
the 
condition 
that 
the 
trial 
sponsor 
uses 
the 
service 
for 
information 
exchange, 
and 
that 
CROs 
and 
trial 
investigators 
are 
used 
supporting 
this 
methodology. 
By 
law, 
many 
trials 
that 
study 
drugs, 
biologics, 
or 
devices 
are 
required 
to 
register 
with 
the 
clinicaltrials.gov 
portal17, 
so 
requiring 
a 
registration 
with 
a 
service 
like 
this 
could 
be 
feasible. 


To 
encourage 
use 
of 
the 
service 
and 
ensure 
data 
integrity, 
only 
data 
on 
the 
blockchain 
would 
be 
considered 
when 
reviewing 
potential 
approval 
of 
a 
drug. 
Hence, 
any 
offline 
personal 
transactions 
of 
data 
such 
as 
through 
email 
would 
be 
discouraged. 
Although 
blockchain 
technology 
provides 
a 
means 
of 
recording 
data 
into 
structures 
that 
are 
immutable, 
traceable, 
and 
verifiable, 
it 
cannot 
prevent 
data 
from 
being 
falsified 
at 
the 
point 
of 
origin. 
Clinicians 
or 
clinical 
researchers 
can 
be 
careless 
or 
fraudulent 
and 
record 
misleading 
data 
into 
the 
CRFs, 
and 
statisticians 
within 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
can 
overinflate 
pvalues 
because 
of 
vested 
interests 
in 
success. 
These 
mistakes 
would 
be 
carried 
forward 
in 
the 
blockchain. 
The 
ideal 
would 
be 
to 
encourage 
the 
most 
raw 
forms 
of 
data 
or 
input 
to 
be 
captured 
as 
early 
as 
possible 
into 
the 
blockchain. 
Regardless, 
with 
unfalsifiable 
data 
collected 
from 
clinical 
investigators 
and 
cleaned 
by 
CROs 
before 
being 
sent 
to 
the 
sponsors, 
regulators 
would 
have 
the 
raw 
data 
to 
validate 
the 
statistical 
results 
due 
to 
the 
design 
of 
blockchain. 
Independent 
statistical 
analyses 
can 
be 
run 
to 
verify 
the 
results. 
The 
sponsoring 
statisticians 
and 
CROs 
could 
also 
be 
required 
to 
post 
their 
Python 
and 
R 
analysis 
scripts 
and 
freeze 
these 
on 
the 
ledger 
for 
verification 
and 
reproducibility, 
though 
this 
is 
not 
necessary 
or 
critical 
to 
the 
blockchain 
architecture 
and 
merely 
an 
example 
of 
how 
the 
chain 
can 
be 
potentially 
utilized 
after 
its 
creation. 
More 
generally, 
by 
being 
able 
to 
see 
each 
edge 
in 
the 
network 
and 
the 
corresponding 
transaction 
and 
values, 
regulators 
are 
able 
to 
confidently 
cross 
check 
the 
results 
of 
any 
given 
subsequent 
transaction. 


By 
providing 
each 
patient 
with 
a 
verification 
code 
to 
give 
to 
their 
physician 
and 
validate 
the 
CRF 
upon 
visit, 
patient 
interaction 
is 
ensured. 
Note 
that 
this 
is 
independent 
to 
the 
functionality 
of 
the 
blockchain 
infrastructure 
and 
design, 
and 
merely 
an 
additional 
modification 
we 
propose 
to 
the 
clinical 
trials 
process 
with 
feasibility 
and 
ease 
yet 
to 
be 
tested. 
Unfortunately, 
if 
a 
patient 
and 
fraudulent 
clinician 
are 
in 
full 
adverse 
cooperation, 
there 
is 
no 
way 
of 
assuring 
that 
real 
data 
are 
generated 
for 
that

office 
visit. 
In 
theory, 
physicians 
could 
still 
fraudulently 
purchase 
these 
verification 
codes 
from 
patients 
to 
save 
time 
and 
avoid 
running 
the 
test 
trial, 
but 
adding 
a 
verification 
code 
provides 
a 
deterrent 
from 
blatantly 
fabricating 
CRFs. 
Fabricating 
data 
will 
require 
the 
involvement 
and 
cooperation 
of 
the 
patient. 
This 
will 
be 
less 
enticing 
and 
riskier 
for 
the 
clinician 
to 
generate 
fake 
CRFs, 
as 
the 
clinician 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
only 
party 
with 
knowledge 
of 
the 
forgery. 
Discovery 
of 
malpractice 
is 
now 
more 
likely 
and 
can 
make 
administering 
the 
office 
visit 
treatment 
more 
attractive 
than 
fabrication. 
Additionally, 
moving 
clinicians 
away 
from 
paperbased 
recordings 
and 
forms 
may 
also 
be 
difficult, 
but 
not 
impossible 
as 
the 
move 
towards 
electronic 
health 
records 
(EHRs) 
rises 
and 
as 
the 
public 
concern 
for 
non-standardized 
and 
fallible 
physical 
documentation 
increases. 
In 
contrast 
to 
physical 
documentation, 
which 
can 
be 
convincingly 
modified, 
digital 
documents 
through 
our 
blockchain 
service 
cannot 
be 
changed 
without 
being 
noticed 
and 
invalidated. 
Accommodating 
the 
current 
standard 
of 
paper 
documentation 
is 
still 
possible 
with 
the 
service, 
since 
these 
can 
be 
easily 
scanned 
and 
converted 
to 
a 
digitized 
data 
type 
to 
be 
added 
to 
the 
immutable 
ledger. 


We 
chose 
to 
give 
data 
storage 
control 
to 
the 
regulator, 
as 
opposed 
to 
distributing 
data 
storage 
to 
nodes 
across 
participants 
in 
the 
network 
like 
in 
Bitcoin 
applications. 
We 
preferred 
this 
design 
because 
the 
trial 
regulator 
is 
the 
only 
party 
that 
can 
and 
must 
be 
trusted, 
since 
this 
party 
is 
the 
one 
having 
final 
approval 
over 
success 
or 
rejection 
of 
the 
treatment. 
It 
is 
a 
central 
authority 
that 
cannot 
be 
eliminated. 
We 
feel 
implementing 
distributed 
storage 
to 
everyone 
in 
the 
network 
(such 
as 
that 
used 
for 
Bitcoin) 
does 
not 
fit 
this 
regulatory 
context 
well, 
and 
is 
also 
impractical 
as 
all 
parties 
would 
also 
have 
to 
locally 
store 
data 
pertinent 
to 
the 
clinical 
trial 
on 
their 
machines. 
Requiring 
usage 
of 
a 
web 
application 
is 
a 
much 
more 
feasible 
first 
step, 
and 
the 
regulator 
can 
have 
more 
refined 
control 
over 
the 
data 
and 
abstract 
management 
away 
from 
the 
users. 


This 
service 
could 
be 
an 
improvement 
to 
the 
current 
clinical 
system, 
and 
could 
be 
integrated 
into 
existing 
workflows 
with 
the 
use 
of 
a 
web-based 
platform, 
such 
as 
the 
one 
prototyped 
here. 
A 
service 
like 
this 
could 
be 
especially 
useful 
in 
the 
context 
of 
international 
clinical 
trials 
in 
which 
oversight 
is 
more 
difficult 
to 
administer1. 
Moreover, 
there 
is 
an 
added 
benefit 
to 
the 
regulator 
as 
overwatch 
and 
monitoring 
in 
real-time 
since 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
trial 
could 
be 
more 
feasible, 
and 
the 
regulator 
need 
not 
wait 
until 
a 
final 
summary 
package 
is 
delivered 
by 
the 
sponsor 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
trial. 
However, 
current 
regulatory 
bodies 
might 
not 
be 
ready 
to 
deal 
with 
real-time 
data 
access. 


This 
framework 
can 
also 
serve 
to 
advance 
the 
initiative 
towards 
open 
and 
publicly 
accessible 
big 
data, 
as 
the 
regulator 
can 
selectively 
decide 
which 
data 
elements 
to 
release 
to 
the 
public 
on 
the 
portal 
for 
each 
clinical 
trial. 
For 
future 
directions, 
the 
portal 
can 
be 
easily 
expanded 
in 
functionality 
to 
include 
services 
similar 
to 
clinicaltrials.gov, 
and 
also 
open 
access 
to 
raw 
data 
for 
research 
scientists 
like 
the 
concept 
behind 
the 
ImmPort 
repository14.An 
interesting 
future 
direction 
and 
direct 
application 
would 
be 
to 
use 
this 
methodology 
to 
broadcast 
information 
that 
the 
trial 
sponsor 
and 
regulator 
deem 
fit 
to 
show 
to 
the 
general 
public 
directly 
through 
the 
clinicaltrials.gov 
portal. 
This 
could 
be 
an 
exciting 
avenue 
that 
both 
takes 
advantage 
of 
the 
efficiencies 
in 
speed 
and 
security 
that 
this 
proof 
of 
concept 
has 
to 
offer, 
along 
with 
maintaining 
regulator 
discretion 
and 
control 
over 
data. 
Of 
course, 
much 
work 
would 
be 
needed 
before 
this 
hypothetical 
direction 
can 
be 
realized. 
The 
idea 
of 
open 
access 
to 
clinical 
trials 
data 
are 
a 
debated 
topic18,19, 
but 
services 
like 
ImmPort 
have 
shown 
that 
there 
is 
a 
desire 
among 
trial 
sponsors 
and 
the 
scientific 
community, 
notably 
the 
National 
Institute 
of 
Allergy 
and 
Infectious 
Disease 
(NIAID) 
and 
National 
Institutes 
of 
Health 
(NIH), 
to 


make 
this 
data 
accessible 
and 
open14. 
In 
addition, 
the 
International 
Committee 
of 
Medical 
Journal 
Editors 
(ICMJE) 
has 
expressed 
their 
commitment 
to 
promoting 
clinical 
research 
data 
to 
be 
openly 
available18. 


We 
propose 
leaving 
the 
question 
of 
opening 
access 
to 
trials 
data 
to 
a 
case-by-case 
decision 
of 
the 
regulator 
and 
sponsor, 
if 
they 
wish 
to 
disseminate 
data 
on 
the 
chain, 
keeping 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
feasibility 
of 
maintaining 
patient 
privacy 
and 
data 
usability 
is 
a 
question 
that 
needs 
a 
case-by-case 
perspective. 
Our 
proposal 
and 
proof 
of 
concept 
can 
be 
synthesized 
in 
a 
methodology 
that 
combines 
ideas 
of 
open 
access 
data 
sharing, 
and 
the 
resulting 
security 
and 
trust 
benefits 
that 
arise 
from 
blockchain 
technology. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
however 
that 
our 
blockchain 
service 
does 
not 
solve 
or 
speak 
to 
the 
complex 
issues 
of 
public 
data 
sharing, 
and 
we 
are 
simply 
advocating 
this 
as 
a 
potential 
post-trial 
use 
of 
the 
service 
if 
the 
regulator 
deems 
it 
responsible 
and 
safe. 
All 
of 
the 
additional 
functionality 
that 
we 
propose 
can 
be 
integrated 
into 
this 
system, 
and 
we 
will 
have 
a 
unified 
platform 
for 
all 
things 
clinical 
trial 
catering 
to 
the 
researcher, 
regulator, 
and 
potentially 
public 
client. 
If 
a 
service 
like 
the 
one 
that 
we 
propose 
in 
this 
paper 
can 
be 
adopted, 
the 
benefits 
of 
immutability, 
traceability, 
and 
more 
trust 
in 
the 
clinical 
research 
process 
can 
ensue. 
Regulators 
can 
confidently 
track 
the 
complex 
flow 
of 
data 
throughout 
a 
trial, 
and 
be 
kept 
up 
to 
date 
on 
safety 
proceedings 
and 
progress. 


Methods 
Portal

We 
built 
a

to

The

was

Django 
software 
development 
framework, 
with 
additional 
Python

CRF 
extraction. 
In 
order 
to 
test 
the 
utility 
of 
this 
service 
with 
real 
world 
data, 
we 
used 
open 
access 
data 
from 
a 
real 
completed 
clinical 
trial: 
Efficacy 
and 
Safety 
Evaluation 
of 
Allergen 
Immunotherapy 
Co-Administered 
with 
Omalizumab 
(NCT00078195)13. 
The 
trial 
had 
a 
total 
of 
159 
patients 
and 
four 
treatment 
arms 
(see 
Supplemental 
Table 
2). 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
brevity 
and 
clarity, 
we 
extracted 
information 
from 
four 
patients 
in 
total, 
one 
per 
treatment 
type. 
Only 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
large 
wealth 
of 
CRF 
data 
were 
mirrored 
for 
the 
simulation. 
Broad 
information 
like 
race, 
gender, 
and 
age 
were 
included. 
Since 
the 
clinical 
trial 
was 
studying 
allergen 
immunotherapy, 
we 
also 
extracted 
relevant 
assay 
measurements 
such 
as 
free 
IgG-a 
and 
free 
IgE-a 
concentrations 
in 
the 
blood. 
Additional 
relevant 
immunological 
data, 
such 
as 
concentrations 
of 
white 
blood 
cells 
were 
extracted, 
and 
included 
measurements 
for 
monocytes, 
neutrophils, 
eosinophils, 
basophils, 
and 
lymphocytes. 
Concentrations 
of 
red 
blood 
cells, 
corpuscular 
hemoglobin, 
and 
platelets 
were 
also 
extracted 
and 
recorded 
into 
the 
CRFs. 
Known 
adverse 
events 
reported 
during 
the 
trial 
period 
were 
also 
parsed 
and 
included 
in 
the 
digitized 
CRFs. 
We 
inserted 
a 
necessary 
verification 
code 
on 
each 
CRF, 
with 
the 
motivation 
of 
encouraging 
patient 
and 
clinician 
interaction. 
To 
meet 
the 
requirement 
of 
a 
verification 
code 
being 
present 
to 
legitimize 
the 
CRF, 
we 
simulated 
the 
patient 
providing 
the 
verification 
code 
(received 
from 
the 
IVRS) 
to 
the 
clinical 
investigator 
staff 
to 
place 
on 
the 
CRF. 
Upon 
audit, 
the 
regulator 
would 
check 
that 
each 
CRF 
has 
the 
necessary 
verification 
code 
in 
a 
process 
that 
can 
be 
readily 
machine 
automated.
