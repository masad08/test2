INTRODUCTION 


Abstract 


Patient 
enrollment, 
data 
sharing, 
and 
data 
privacy 
are 
enormous 
medical 
challenges 
for 
clinical 
trial 
studies. 
In 
recent 
years, 
blockchain 
technology 
has 
drawn 
the 
attention 
of 
various 
researchers 
and 
institutes. 
As 
a 
new 
and 
innovative 
distributed 
ledger 
technology, 
blockchain 
can 
be 
critical 
to 
addressing 
these 
challenges, 
thus 
making 
clinical 
research 
transparent 
and 
building 
public 
trust 
fairly 
and 
openly. 
However, 
the 
existing 
literature 
lacks 
a 
comprehensive 
survey 
on 
the 
adoption 
of 
blockchain 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
To 
fill 
the 
research 
void, 
this 
paper 
presents 
a 
punctilious 
taxonomy 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trials 
according 
to 
the 
literature. 
This 
taxonomy 
comprises 
decentralized 
scenarios, 
decentralized 
practices, 
blockchain 
types, 
deployment 
methods, 
and 
consensus 
algorithms. 
The 
results 
show 
that 
blockchain 
technology 
can 
cover 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
clinical 
trial 
study 
in 
a 
decentralized, 
secure, 
transparent 
manner. 
Besides, 
some 
open 
research 
challenges 
of 
blockchain 
are 
categorized 
into 
three 
groups: 
technical 
challenges, 
security 
challenges, 
and 
organizational 
challenges. 
Moreover, 
some 
recent 
blockchain 
projects, 
micro 
applications 
in 
clinical 
trials, 
and 
several 
research 
areas 
or 
technologies 
for 
future 
research 
and 
development 
are 
discussed.

The 
current 
process 
for 
clinical 
trials 


to 
distributed 
ledger 
systems 
and 
mobile 
apps, 
this 
technology 
is 
being 
embraced 
across 
all 
industries, 
and 
its 
use 
has 
become 
a 
significant 
plus 
for 
businesses. 
As 
the 
technology 
improves, 
different 
applications 
beyond 
financial 
and 
banking 
services 
have 
been 
investigated 
[11–14]; 
the 
healthcare 
business 
could 
benefit 
from 
its 
adoption 
[15–23]. 
For 
instance, 
blockchain-based 
models 
for 
electronic 
medical 
records 
have 
been 
suggested 
to 
enable 
individuals 
to 
exert 
more 
control 
over 
their 
medical 
data 
and 
improve 
data 
exchange 
across 
platforms 
[24–26]. 
Furthermore, 
blockchain 
technology 
has 
been 
used 
in 
forestalling 
pandemics 
[27] 
and 
remote 
patient 
monitoring 
[28]. 
The 
features 
of 
blockchain 
technology, 
such 
as 
data 
transparency 
and 
traceability, 
have 
accelerated 
the 
reformation 
of 
current 
healthcare 
institutions, 
including 
health 
data 
interchange 
and 
patient 
follow-up 
through 
transaction 
trace 
[29]. 


Utilizing 
blockchain 
technology 
to 
manage 
clinical 
trial 
databases 
shows 
great 
potential 
for 
enhancing 
research 
in 
pharmaceutical 
industries. 
Besides, 
blockchain 
can 
disrupt 
the 
clinical 
trial 
industry 
while 
diminishing 
the 
use 
of 
legacy 
data 
management 
platforms 
[30–32]. 
Blockchain 
technology 
could 
directly 
address 
the 
present 
issues 
with 
clinical 
trials 
and 
improve 
the 
management 
of 
clinical 
trials 
by 
regulatory 
bodies 
and 
research 
institutes. 
Besides, 
it 
could 
enhance 
the 
underlying 
technology 
of 
clinical 
trial 
research, 
ultimately 
boosting 
the 
credibility 
of 
clinical 
studies. 
In 
clinical 
trials, 
a 
Peer-to-Peer 
(P2P) 
network 
is 
created 
using 
blockchain 
technology 
to 
record 
data 
interactions 
throughout 
clinical 
trials, 
enable 
data 
exchange, 
and 
make 
trial 
data 
visible 
and 
immutable 
[33–35]. 
The 
smart 
contract 
[36], 
which 
functions 
as 
a 
decentralized 
program 
that 
lives 
on 
the 
blockchain, 
can 
automate 
these 
procedures. 
For 
example, 
it 
could 
fulfil 
numerous 
functions 
concurrently, 
such 
as 
automating 
the 
business 
logic 
of 
an 
application 
without 
involving 
third 
parties, 
assuring 
data 
provenance, 
producing 
immutable 
audit 
trails, 
and 
imposing 
duties 
on 
an 
action 
if 
specific 
rules 
are 
satisfied 
[37]. 
Tools 
using 
blockchain 
technology 
can 
automatically 
link 
and 
distribute 
healthcare 
data 
to 
other 
researchers 
and 
clinics. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
immutability 
of 
blockchain 
records, 
auditing 
and 
data 
verification 
are 
facilitated. 
The 
integrity 
of 
immutable 
clinical 
trial 
data 
stored 
on 
a 
blockchain 
can 
inspire 
more 
faith, 
resulting 
in 
safer 
medications 
and 
increased 
public 
confidence 
in 
scientific 
research. 


Figure 
2 
describes 
the 
process 
of 
a 
clinical 
trial 
based 
on 
blockchain 
technology. 
Unlike 
the 
current 
process 
of 
clinical 
trials 
shown 
in 
Figure 
1, 
the 
data 
among 
different 
stakeholders 
is 
transparent 
and 
accessible. 
The 
blockchain 
preserves 
a 
complete, 
up-to-date 
history 
of 
all 
trial-related 
data, 
including 
the 
clinical 
protocol, 
visit 
history, 
subject 
info 
etc., 
which 
would 
track 
the 
enrolled 
subject 
during 
the 
clinical 
trial 
study. 
The 
data 
lake 
serves 
as 
an 
isolated 
data 
repository, 
known 
as 
off-chain 
storage. 
The 
blockchain 
network 
consists 
of 
trusted 
validating 
peers, 
and 
each 
peer 
holds 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
ledger 
for 
the 
network 
to 
maintain 
the 
consistence 
of 
the 
distributed 
ledger. 
The 
clinical 
director 
can 
access 
the 
trial-related 
data 
through 
any 
network 
peer 
where 
their 
information 
is 
preserved. 
This 
is 
realized 
by 
specifying 
the 
access 
control 
policy 
in 
the 
smart 
contract, 
which 
is 
deployed 
into 
the 
entire 
blockchain 
network 
to 
ensure 
data 
privacy 
and 
security. 
All 
the 
end 
users 
and 
blockchain 
interactions 
are 
encrypted 
with 
a 
digital 
signature 
to 
ensure 
the 
system’s 
security.

the 
proposed 
survey 
with 
recent, 
state-of-the-art 
reviews 
of 
using 
blockchain 
in 
the 
healthcare 
sector. 
The 
development 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
is 
still 
in 
its 
infancy, 
though 
previous 
studies 
have 
validated 
it 
in 
several 
use 
cases 
in 
the 
healthcare 
sector. 
The 
current 
literature 
lacks 
a 
comprehensive

fill 
this 
gap, 
we

of 
blockchain 
technology 
in

PHASES 
OF 
CLINICAL 
TRIALS 


Human 
participants 
are 
used 
in 
clinical 
trials 
to 
determine 
if 
a 
drug 
is 
useful 
and 
what 
negative 
effects 
it 
may 
produce. 
The 
trials 
collect 
information 
on 
a 
treatment 
whose 
efficacy 
in 
treating 
a 
particular 
ailment 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
established. 
A 
drug 
being 
evaluated 
in 
a 
clinical 
study 
is 
an 
experimental 
drug 
[38]. 
Before 
a 
novel 
treatment 
can 
be 
utilized 
in 
a 
clinical 
trial, 
it 
must 
undergo 
preclinical 
testing. 
All 
in 
vitro 
(test-tube 
or 
laboratory) 
research 
and 
animal 
experiments 
include 
preclinical 
testing. 
To 
determine 
preliminary 
efficacy, 
toxicity, 
and 
pharmacokinetics, 
several 
doses 
of 
the 
test 
medication 
or 
an 
in-vitro 
substrate 
are 
administered 
to 
animals 
[39–40]. 


In 
different 
rounds 
of 
clinical 
trials, 
new 
drugs 
and 
therapies 
are 
evaluated 
for 
their 
ability 
to 
combat 
freshly 
discovered 
or 


existing 
pathologies. 
These 
clinical 
trial 
stages 
are 
the 
measures 
scientists 
take 
to 
test 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
novel 
drugs 
or 
therapies 
on 
a 
limited 
sample 
of 
patients. 
As 
represented 
in 
Figure 
3, 
a 
new 
treatment 
goes 
through 
several 
phases. 
Each 
phase 
has 
a 
different 
purpose: 
phase 
1 
trials 
test 
if 
a 
new 
treatment 
is 
safe 
and 
look 
for 
the 
best 
way 
to 
give 
the 
treatment. 
Phase 
1 
trials 
usually 
include 
less 
than 
100 
patients 
divided 
into 
small 
groups. 
Doctors 
also 
look 
for 
signs 
that 
the 
disease 
responds 
to 
the 
new 
treatment; 
Phase 
2 
trials 
test 
if 
one 
type 
of 
disease 
responds 
to 
the 
new 
treatment, 
100–300 
patients 
usually 
join 
a 
phase 
2 
trial. 
If 
the 
new 
treatment 
works, 
doctors 
may 
go 
on 
to 
study 
in 
a 
phase 
3 
trial; 
Phase 
3 
trials 
test 
if 
a 
new 
treatment 
is 
better 
than 
a 
standard 
treatment. 
Phase 
3 
trials 
may 
include 
300–3000 
patients 
worldwide; 
Phase 
4 
trials 
find 
more 
information 
about 
long-term 
benefits 
and 
side 
effects.

ISSUES 
IN 
CURRENT 
CLINICAL

A 
continual 
and 
effective 
flow 
of 
medical 
advances 
is 
essential 
for 
meeting 
society’s 
rising 
medical 
demands. 
Ongoing 
study 
indicates 
that 
drug 
development 
costs 
increase 
by 
9% 
annually 
[43]. 
There 
are 
issues 
with 
all 
facets 
of 
drug 
clinical 
trials, 
including 
preparation 
before 
clinical 
trials, 
protecting 
subjects’ 
rights 
and 
interests, 
and 
implementing, 
recording, 
and 
managing 
clinical

samples. 
This 
section 
discusses 
several 
issues 
in 
current

3.1 


Data 
reliability 


In 
recent 
years, 
there 
have 
been 
some 
cases 
of 
clinical 
trial 
fraud 
at 
home 
and 
abroad, 
mainly 
involving 
data 
fraud 
and 
selective 
publication, 
which 
have 
caused 
public 
bias 
against 
clinical 
trials. 
In 
a 
survey 
of 
researchers 
in 
clinical 
drug 
trials, 
about 
17% 
reported 
being 
aware 
of 
data 
tampering 
or 
falsification 
[44]. 
For 
instance, 
in 
July 
2014, 
Science 
reported 
that 
Japanese 
researchers 
falsified 
data 
in 
the 
antihypertensive 
drug 
Diovan 
clinical 
trial. 
Data 
integrity, 
standardization, 
and 
authenticity 
are 
essential 
requirements 
for 
clinical 
trials. 
The 
problems 
of 
integrity 
and 
standardization 
are 
mainly 
due 
to 
data 
missing, 
which 
is 
insufficient 
to 
judge 
the 
validity 
and 
safety. 
The 
authenticity 
problems 
involve 
fraud, 
including 
the 
fabrication, 
tampering, 
concealing 
of 
data, 
and 
the 
inability 
to 
trace 
the 
original 
data. 


3.2 


Irregular 
informed 
consent 
process 


Clinical 
trials 
cannot 
be 
separated 
from 
the 
participation 
of 
patients. 
However, 
the 
informed 
consent 
process 
in 
previous 


clinical 
trials 
was 
not 
rigorous, 
and 
some 
patients 
participating 
in 
clinical 
trials 
were 
not 
clear 
about 
the 
process 
and 
content 
of 
the 
trial. 
The 
FDA 
pointed 
out 
in 
the 
research 
report 
that 
nearly 
10% 
of 
the 
trials 
had 
defects 
in 
implementing 
informed 
consent, 
such 
as 
expanding 
the 
scope 
of 
information 
acquisition 
and 
modifying 
informed 
consent 
without 
permission. 
Article 
25 
to 
32 
of 
the 
Declaration 
of 
Helsinki 
[45] 
stipulates 
that 
subjects 
in 
clinical 
trials 
must 
obtain 
consent 
from 
the 
subjects. 
Researchers 
must 
inform 
the 
clinical 
trial 
objectives, 
methods, 
risks, 
and 
other 
contents. 
In 
practice, 
the 
number 
of 
tested 
patients 
is 
large, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
phase 
4 
clinical 
trial 
subjects 
is 
more 
than 
2000. 
It 
is 
a 
significant 
workload 
to 
obtain 
informed 
consent, 
and 
informed 
consent 
is 
not 
a 
one-time 
but 
a 
repeated 
cycle 
process. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
urgent 
to 
adopt 
a 
new 
method 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
informed 
consent 
in 
clinical 
trials.

Data

and

errors 
may 
occur 
between 
multiple 
drug 
clinical 
trial 
centres 
and 
sponsors 
or 
between 
sponsors 
and 
government-related 
regulatory 
agencies. 
In 
the 
current 
drug 
clinical 
trial 
system, 
the 
inspection 
and 
verification 
of 
data 
by 
the 
relevant 
government 
supervision 
institutions 
are 
delayed 
significantly. 
The 
efficiency 
of 
reviewing 
different 
drug 
clinical 
trial 
data 
needs 
to 
be 
further 
improved. 
Several 
eClinical 
technologies 
have 
arisen 
in 
the 
last 
decade 
to 
streamline 
trial 
operations 
and 
data 
administration. 
Existing 
fully-integrated 
and 
comprehensive 
eClinical 
systems 
are 
only 
available 
to 
major 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
since 
they 
are 
prohibitively 
costly. 
For 
authorities 
that 
have 
difficulty 
monitoring 
research 
data, 
there 
is 
no 
easy 
and 
safe 
way 
to 
see 
the 
complex 
network 
of 
data 
exchange, 
no 
real-time 
access 
to 
results 
once 
they 
are 
made, 
and 
no 
simple 
way 
to 
track 
historical 
data 
[47–48]. 
Thus, 
the 
FDA 
recognized 
a 
lack 
of 
traceability 
as 
one 
of 
the 
clinical 
research’s 
most 
serious 
data 
problems 
[49]. 


3.4 


Data 
accessibility 


Accessibility 
of 
patient 
data 
is 
another 
significant 
issue 
in 
the 
current 
clinical 
trials 
business 
since 
it 
includes 
several 
specialty 
parties 
and 
spans 
organizational 
and 
national 
lines. 
Participants 
in 
clinical 
trials 
operate 
in 
relative 
isolation, 
using 
their 
software 
systems, 
data 
formats, 
procedures, 
and 
organizations. 
Patient 
data 
are 
often 
spread 
across 
many 
private 
systems 
with 
no 
connection 
or 
collaboration, 
making 
it 
incredibly 
difficult 
to 
recruit 
participants 
for 
clinical 
studies 
[50]. 
Even 
worse, 
when 
scientists 
recruit 
enough 
patients 
to 
launch 
a 
clinical 
trial, 
patients’ 
medical 
conditions 
for 
that 
particular 
therapy 
may 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
problem, 
resulting 
in 
flawed 
research 
with 
false 
positives 
and 
hazardous 
mistakes. 


4 


TAXONOMY 
OF 
BLOCKCHAIN 
TECHNOLOGY 
IN 
CLINICAL 
TRIALS 


This 
section 
overviews 
some 
essential 
characteristics 
that 
enable 
blockchain 
technology 
to 
transform 
conventional 
clinical 
trials. 
As 
shown 
in 
Figure 
4, 
these 
characteristics 
are 
summarized 
and 
categorized 
into 
a 
tree-based 
structure 
according 
to 
existing 
literature. 
The 
taxonomy 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trials 
comprises 
decentralized 
scenarios, 
decentralized 
practices, 
blockchain 
types, 
deployment 
methods, 
and 
consensus 
algorithms. 
The 
relevant 
literature 
in 
clinical 
trials 
analyzed 
in 
this 
section 
is 
summarized 
in 
Table 
3. 
The 
conceptual 
diagram 
of 
the 
blockchain-based 
clinical 
trial 
platform 
is 
briefly 
presented 
in 
Figure 
5. 
The 
physical 
layer 
consists 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
devices 
for 
gathering 
vital 
signals 
from 
patients. 
These 
devices 
allow 
for 
objectively 
measuring 
intervention 
effects 
in 
clinical 
and 
distant 
settings. 
The 
service 
layer’s 
modular 
architecture 
makes 
the 
blockchain 
network 
easier 
to 
maintain 
and 
expand. 
This 
layer 
incorporates 
many 
properties 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
as 
separate 
modules, 
including 
P2P 
protocol, 
certificate 
authority, 
event 
hub, 
and 
consensus. 
The 
distributed 
ledger 
is 
a 
decentralized 
storage

Taxonomy 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trials 


non-tampering, 
and 
high 
privacy 
characteristics. 
This 
subsection 
explains 
how 
blockchain 
technology 
helps 
to 
enhance 
various 
scenarios 
in 
conventional 
clinical 
trials. 


Patient 
recruitment 


It 
is 
highly 
esteemed 
and 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
the 
common 
concept 
that 
enrolling 
patients 
for 
clinical 
trial 
studies 
are 
very 
complicated 
during 
drug 
development. 
It 
is 
claimed 
that 
a 
considerable 
portion 
of 
the 
expenditures 
associated 
with 
developing 
a 
novel 
drug 
is 
allocated 
to 
recruiting 
eligible 
patients 
and 
identifying 
adequate 
retention 
strategies 
throughout 
the 
clinical 
trial 
process 
[51]. 
Furthermore, 
it 
has 
been 
stated 
that 
most 
clinical 
studies 
are 
postponed 
or 
even 
forced 
to 
cancel 
due 
to 
recruitment 
issues 
[52]. 
The 
conventional 
patient 
recruitment 
process 
can 
benefit 
from 
the 
characteristics 
of 
blockchain 
technology, 
maintaining 
the 
patients’ 
confidentiality 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
trial 
data. 


Blockchain 
technology 
can 
handle 
two 
major 
clinical 
trial 
recruitment 
tasks. 
First, 
it 
can 
help 
sponsors 
recruit 
patients 
efficiently 
[53] 
to 
reach 
out 
to 
the 
right 
population 
of 
patients 
in 
a 
timely 
fashion. 
The 
clinical 
trial 
general 
information 
can 
be 
broadcasted 
to 
specific 
recruiting 
physicians 
through 
the 
blockchain 
network. 
Second, 
it 
can 
inform 
patients 
of 
new 
trials 
by 
automatically 
matching 
their 
profile 
with 
the 
trial’s 
inclusion 
and 
exclusion 
criteria. 
This 
is 
accomplished 
via 
smart 
contracts 
[54], 
which 
can 
automatically 
authenticate 
transactions 
inside 
the 
blockchain 
to 
assure 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
sponsors, 
clinical 


Algorithm 

studies, 
and 
patient 
eligibility. 
All 
participating 
trial 
sites 
could 
receive 
recruitment 
information 
from 
the 
sponsors 
without 
going 
through 
the 
conventional 
digital 
medial 
channels. 


Another 
study 
explores 
the 
potential 
of 
merging 
the 
IoT 
and 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
the 
digital 
health 
sector 
[55]. 
The 
IoT 
devices 
can 
continuously 
collect 
the 
personal 
data 
preserved 
in 
clinical 
sites 
to 
prescreen 
the 
potential 
participants 
in 
terms 
of 
specified 
inclusion 
and 
exclusion 
criteria. 
Before 
an 
agreement 
is 
made, 
the 
patient 
can 
keep 
the 
data 
secret, 
and 
the 
Clinical 
Research 
Institute 
can 
be 
satisfied 
that 
the 
data 
is 
useful 
and 
legitimate. 
Thus, 
the 
convergence 
of 
IoT 
and 
blockchain 
can 
safeguard 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
patients 
and 
the 
Clinical 
Research 
Institute. 
The 
authors 
in 
[56] 
propose 
using 
mobile 
computing 
with 
blockchain 
technology 
to 
implement 
a 
patient-centred 
model 
in 
participant 
recruitment 
and 
data 
sharing. 
However, 
this 
study 
only 
presents 
a 
conceptual 
architecture 
and 
lacks 
proof-of-concept. 


4.1.2 


Consent 
traceability 


Patient 
participation 
is 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
better 
clinical 
trials 
and 
medical 
research 
[57]. 
However, 
informed 
consent 
is 
challenging 
to 
manage 
rigorously 
and 
successfully. 
According 
to 
research 
published 
by 
the 
FDA 
[58], 
about 
10% 
of 
clinical 
studies 
have 
various 
concerns 
with 
consent 
gathering. 
Some 
regulation 
agencies, 
including 
the 
FDA, 
have 
provided 
recommendations 
and 
commitments 
to 
promote 
consent 
collection 
under 
suitable 
conditions 
[59]. 
According 
to 
the 
recommendation

technology 
can 
provide 
a 
secure 
and 
straightforward 
way 
to 
sign 
and 
date 
the

In 
this 
context, 
the 
blockchain 
can 
bring 
a 
solid 
basis 
for 
transparency 
in 
gathering 
patients’ 
consent. 
The 
authors 
in 
[60]designa 


blockchain-based 
proof-of-concept 
protocol 
to 
time

A

is 
obtained 
to

protocol 
version 
is

This 
document 
is 
thus 
secure, 
solid 
evidence 
of 
existence 
that 
can 
be 
confirmed 
on 
any 
public 
website 
devoted 
to 
the 
purpose. 
The 
e-consent 
model 
employs 
an 
access 
control 
technique 
developed 
on 
the 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
blockchain 
architecture 
[61]. 
It 
maintains 
all 
information 
associated 
with 
patient 
records, 
consents, 
and 
data 
access 
that 
may 
be 
transferred 
across 
participating 
organizations. 
Block-
Trial 
[62] 
is 
an 
additional 
mechanism 
that 
enables 
patients 
to 
authorize 
researchers 
to 
access 
their 
data 
and 
submit 
queries 
for 
blockchain-stored 
data. 
It 
provides 
a 
web-based 
interface 
allowing 
the 
end-users 
to 
invoke 
the 
trial-related 
services 
exposed 
in 
the 
smart 
contract. 


The 
Trusted 
Information 
Project 
Platform 
(TIP-Platform) 


[63] 
is 
a 
trustworthy 
study 
that 
enables 
participants 
to 
view 
and 
use 
project-related 
information 
such 
as 
research 
results 
and 
duplication 
reviews. 
However, 
it 
does 
not 
target 
consent 
traceability. 
Other 
prototypes 
allow 
data 
subjects 
to 
control 
consent 
regarding 
access 
to 
their 
data 
in 
the 
IoT 
ecosystem. 
ADvoCATE 
is 
a 
user-centric 
solution 
that 
ensures 
the 
integrity 
of 
personal 
data 
processing 
consent 
[64]. 
Another 
similar 
project 
utilizes 
an 
Active 
Assisted 
Living 
(AAL) 
technology-based 
data 
collection 
scheme 
to 
integrate 
with 
the 
blockchain 
to 
improve 
transparency 
in 
the 
consent 
management 
process 
[65]. 
Persistent 
monitoring 


In 
conventional 
clinical 
trial 
programs, 
patients’ 
symptoms 
and 
physical 
conditions 
are 
reported 
using 
a 
questionnaire 
or 
a 
diary 
to 
the 
clinical 
site. 
Data 
accuracy 
and 
integrity 
are 
hard 
to 
maintain 
since 
the 
FDA 
only 
receives 
combined 
reports 
from 
sponsors. 
It 
is 
difficult 
for 
the 
current 
system 
to 
feature 
real-time 
collection 
and 
analysis 
of 
the 
data 
as 
the 
process 
is 
complex. 
Furthermore, 
the 
FDA 
lacks 
the 
workforce 
to 
perform 
regular 
inspections 
of 
all 
clinical 
trial 
data 
reported 
from 
each 
clinical 
site. 
Blockchain 
can 
allow 
the 
FDA 
and 
sponsors 
to 
trace 
the 
monitored 
data 
incessantly, 
open 
to 
all 
participants 
within 
the 
same 
network 
as 
a 
distributed 
ledger 
technology. 
In 
this 
context, 
permissioned 
blockchain 
is 
more 
suitable 
than 
permissionless 
blockchain 
since 
it 
outperforms 
transaction 
processing 
capability. 
The 
FDA, 
clinical 
sites, 
sponsors, 
and 
patients 
can 
participate 
in 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain 
that 
establishes 
an 
incredible 
trust. 
Moreover, 
an 
Application 
Program 
Interface 
(API) 
can 
be 
used 
in 
permissioned 
blockchain 
to 
allow 
all 
patients 
to 
send 
their 
questionnaires 
or 
diaries 
to 
other 
network 
participants 
through 
smart 
devices. 


Authors 
in 
[53] 
present 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain-based 
reference 
model 
for 
persistent 
monitoring. 
This 
model 
covers 
different 
phases 
of 
the 
clinical 
trial 
program. 
The 
smart 
contract 
validates 
the 
participants’ 
identity 
and 
can 
query 
the 
health 
data 
within 
the 
permissioned 
blockchain. 
Unlike 
the 
conventional 
system, 
the 
proposed 
model 
allows 
the 
FDA 
to 
check 
the 
raw 
data 
and 
other 
analytics 
reports; 
meanwhile, 
patients 
can 
communicate 
with 
the 
FDA 
directly. 
Another 
study 
presents 
a 
layered 
blockchain 
system 
for 
most 
healthcare 
sectors 
involving 
data 
coordination 
across 
multiple 
facilities 
[66]. 
It 
provides 


some 
standard 
functions 
to 
ease 
the 
application 
development 
without 
concerning 
the 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
blockchain. 
The 
authors 
in 
[67] 
also 
present 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain 
model 
to 
tackle 
issues 
in 
current 
clinical 
trials. 
A 
proof-of-concept 
work 
is 
implemented 
to 
simulate 
scenarios 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
It 
can 
connect 
multiple 
Healthy 
Eating 
Research 
(HER) 
databases 
from 
clinical 
sites. 
A 
suite 
of 
smart 
contracts 
is 
also 
utilized 
to 
set 
the 
levels 
of 
data 
access 
privileges 
and 
emulate 
the 
workflow 
protocols 
for 
each 
stakeholder 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
The 
authors 
in 
[68] 
propose 
an 
IoT-based 
blockchain 
architecture 
comprising 
five 
layers. 
The 
blockchain 
infrastructure 
is 
built 
on 
the 
Ethereum 
platform, 
and 
the 
smart 
contract 
is 
programmed 
in 
Solidity 
language. 


4.1.4 


Data 
management 


The 
type 
and 
quality 
of 
clinical 
data 
are 
essential 
in 
determining 
clinical 
trial 
research 
results. 
A 
clinical 
data 
management 
system 
must 
handle 
the 
information 
collected 
during 
clinical 
trials. 
It 
is 
widely 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
clinical 
trial 
sector 
is 
crucial 
in 
enhancing 
human 
health. 
The 
reliability 
of 
trial 
data 
is 
essential 
to 
contemporary 
medical 
theory 
and 
practice 
but 
cannot 
be 
guaranteed 
for 
the 
reasons 
outlined 
in 
the 
preceding 
section. 
Blockchain 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
enhancing 
clinical 
research 
techniques 
and 
a 
step 
toward 
achieving 
more 
openness 
to 
increase 
confidence 
among 
research 
organizations, 
clinical 
locations, 
and 
patient 
populations. 
The 
adoption 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
healthcare 
offers 
several 
advantages, 
including 
safe 
data 
monitoring 
and 
sharing, 
data 
availability, 
and 
user 
privacy. 
The 
authors 
in 
[69] 
outline 
the 
scope, 
needs, 
system 
architecture, 
and 
problems 
unique 
to 
clinical 
trials 
and 
precision 
medicine 
for 
blockchain 
technology. 
Several 
organizations 
and 
institutions, 
including 
International 
Business 
Machines 
(IBM) 
Watson 
Health, 
and 
the 
FDA, 
are 
initiating 
a 
project 
describing 
how 
blockchain 
might 
be 
used 
for 
healthcare 
data 
from 
various 
sources, 
including 
clinical 
trials, 
wearables, 
and 
electronic 
health 
records 
[70]. 


For 
instance, 
the 
authors 
in 
[71] 
present 
a 
conceptual 
blockchain 
platform 
architecture 
for 
clinical 
trials 
and 
precision 
medicine 
in 
the 
current 
studies. 
However, 
this 
study 
only 
clarifies 
the 
potential 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trial 
data 
management 
and 
lacks 
real 
implementation. 
The 
authors 
in 
[72] 
provide 
a 
blockchain-based 
service 
platform 
with 
permissions 
to 
assure 
clinical 
data 
transparency 
and 
provide 
clinical 
trial-related 
smart 
contract 
solutions. 
A 
proofof-
concept 
is 
implemented 
using 
Hyperledger 
Fabric, 
and 
the 
system 
performance 
is 
tested 
in 
different 
metrics. 


Moreover, 
some 
start-up 
companies 
also 
investigate 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
data 
management. 
Examples 
of 
such 
projects 
include 
Gem 
Health 
Network 
[73], 
GuardTime 
[74], 
Chronicled 
[75], 
and 
Patientory 
[76]. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Mediterranean 
Hospital 
in 
Cyprus 
has 
adopted 
the 
E-HCert 
application 
[77], 
which 
provides 
an 
archival 
solution 
based 
on 
the 
Vechain 
Thor 
blockchain 
[78]. 
Vechain 
states 
that 
it 
would 
now 
be 
helpful 
for 
hospital 
patients 
to 
conduct 
COVID-19 
tests 
and 
store 
their 
results 
on 
the 
Vechain 
blockchain.

Data 
analytics 


The 
current 
clinical 
data 
management 
systems 
still 
require 
the 
clinical 
sites 
to 
upload 
the 
data 
manually. 
Since 
the 
blockchain 
stores 
all 
transactions, 
real-time 
data 
analytics 
is 
achievable. 
The 
data 
analysis 
process 
can 
be 
automated 
using 
the 
smart 
contract 
to 
collect 
or 
detect 
data 
falsification. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
machine 
learning, 
blockchain 
technology 
can 
perform 
data 
analytics 
in 
the 
healthcare 
sector 
[79]. 
It 
is 
worth 
noting 
that 
some 
researchers 
have 
tried 
to 
apply 
machine 
learning 
algorithms 
in 
the 
smart 
contract 
to 
adjust 
the 
transaction 
traffic 
of 
blockchain 
in 
real-time 
[80]. 
Another 
project 
[81] 
utilizes 
the 
Support 
Vector 
Machine 
(SVM) 
training 
method 
to 
partition 
the 
dataset 
from 
various 
data 
providers 
vertically. 
The 
smart 
contract 
can 
obtain 
decisions 
and 
analytics 
results 
that 
cannot 
be 
tampered 
with 
for 
the 
learning 
phase. 
Although 
not 
related 
to 
clinical 
trials, 
these 
attempts 
show 
that 
the 
data 
analysis 
process 
can 
be 
carried 
out 
automatically 
in 
the 
smart 
contract 
without 
any 
intervention 
from 
clinical 
sites 
or 
sponsors. 
Therefore, 
integrating 
blockchain 
with 
machine 
learning 
can 
provide 
an 
immutable, 
decentralized 
and 
secure 
environment 
for 
learning 
sensitive 
data, 
providing 
substantial 
development 
in 
various 
domains, 
including 
the 
healthcare 
sector, 
as 
discussed 
in 
[82]. 


4.2 


Decentralized 
practices 


Blockchain 
technology 
can 
establish 
a 
new 
trial 
process 
standard 
of 
guaranteeing 
data 
privacy 
and 
maintaining 
data 
integrity 
and 
transparency 
while 
assuring 
regulatory 
compliance. 
Four 
decentralized 
practices 
of 
blockchain 
in 
clinical 
trials 
are 
demonstrated 
in 
Figure 
6. 
The 
subsection 
describes 
how 
blockchain 
technology 
can 
facilitate 
the 
decentralization 
of 
these 
practices 
in 
clinical 
trials. 


4.2.1 


Data 
privacy 


Because 
of 
the 
fast 
development 
of 
information 
technology, 
hospital 
information 
systems 
have 
also 
become 
a 
hot 
research 


topic. 
However, 
these 
medical 
data 
stored 
or 
shared 
on 
public 
networks 
and 
the 
cloud 
are 
threatened 
by 
security 
attacks, 
tampering, 
and 
leakage 
during 
data 
transmission 
[83]. 
Data 
privacy 
is 
one 
of 
the 
characteristics 
of 
blockchain 
that 
best 
fits 
for 
solving 
this 
issue. 
Blockchain-based 
systems 
utilize 
cryptographic 
algorithms 
to 
enhance 
data 
privacy 
and 
security. 
For 
instance, 
the 
Secure 
Hash 
Algorithm 
(SHA) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
cryptographic 
hash 
algorithms 
used 
extensively 
in 
blockchain 
systems. 
The 
Bitcoin 
network 
employs 
the 
SHA-256 
algorithm, 
which 
provides 
a 
256-bit 
fixed-size 
hash 
that 
is 
almost 
unique. 
It 
is 
a 
one-way 
encryption 
function 
that 
cannot 
be 
reversed. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
appropriate 
for 
transaction 
validation, 
antitamper, 
and 
digital 
signatures 
[84]. 
Elliptic 
Curve 
Digital 
Signature 
Algorithm 
(ECDSA) 
is 
another 
popular 
cryptographic 
algorithm 
used 
in 
existing 
blockchain 
systems 
to 
ensure 
the 
effective 
and 
secure 
control 
of 
ownership 
of 
funds 
[85]. 
ECDSA 
utilizes 
asymmetric 
cryptography, 
consisting 
of 
a 
mathematically 
linked 
key 
pair, 
namely 
public 
and 
private 
keys. 
The 
public 
key 
encrypts 
data, 
while 
the 
private 
key 
decrypts 
data. 


4.2.2 


Data 
integrity 


Within 
clinical 
trials, 
the 
data 
integrity 
of 
trial-related 
reports 
and 
documentation 
are 
critical 
keys 
to 
determine 
the 
success 
or 
failure 
of 
the 
whole 
clinical 
trial 
process. 
In 
most 
instances, 
clinicians, 
medical 
labs, 
and 
even 
sponsors 
are 
accountable 
for 
data 
fabrication 
due 
to 
data 
entry 
mistakes. 
Therefore, 
ensuring 
data 
accuracy 
remains 
challenging 
for 
the 
FDA 
since 
they 
only 
get 
aggregated 
reports 
from 
sponsors 
after 
each 
trial; 
thus, 
the 
clearance 
process 
is 
lengthy 
because 
it 
is 
challenging 
to 
make 
timely 
changes 
to 
missing 
or 
incorrect 
data 
under 
the 
present 
clinical 
trial 
system. 
In 
addition, 
the 
FDA 
lacks 
the 
staffing 
needed 
to 
undertake 
periodic 
audits 
of 
all 
registered 
clinical 
trial 
applications. 
Blockchain 
technology 
can 
utilize 
consensus 
algorithms 
to 
prevent 
mistakes 
or 
malicious 
attempts 
[86]. 
Besides, 
hashing-based 
algorithms 
can 
make 
the 
trial 
data 
tamper-proof 
since 
all 
the 
blocks 
are 
logically 
linked 
to 
each 
other. 
All 
transaction 
logs 
are 
preserved 
on 
the 
network, 
making 
the 
FDA 
easy 
and 
quick 
to 
identify 
and 
locate 
the 
source 
of 
problems 
such 
as 
human 
input 
error. 
As 
discussed 
in 
[87], 
permissioned 
blockchain 
has 
many 
advantages 
that 
support 
clinical 
trials 
strongly. 
Permissioned 
blockchain 
is 
more 
appropriate 
for 
clinical 
trials 
as 
it 
provides 
an 
isolated 
environment 
to 
record 
more 
sensitive 
data. 


4.2.3 


Data 
transparency 


Data 
from 
clinical 
trials 
are 
routinely 
withheld 
from 
different 
stakeholders, 
leading 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
trust 
in 
the 
trial 
process 
[88]. 
Lack 
of 
data 
transparency 
can 
hinder 
patients 
from 
getting 
a 
fuller 
and 
clearer 
picture 
of 
treatment 
conditions. 
The 
blockchain 
is 
a 
distributed 
ledger 
technology 
allocated 
among 
all 
trial-related 
stakeholders 
to 
minimize 
the 
probability 
of 
clinical 
sites 
burying 
negative 
results. 
Clinical 
sites 
and 
stakeholders 
can 
keep 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
distributed 
ledger 
and 
get 
the

notification 
in 
real-time 
once 
transactions 
are 
attached 
to 
the 
ledger. 
The 
method 
for 
using 
blockchain 
to 
provide 
data 
transparency 
in 
clinical 
trial 
protocols 
is 
first 
reported 
in 
[89]. 
The 
authors 
propose 
an 
Ethereum-based 
platform 
with 
conventional 
clinical 
data 
management 
systems 
parallelly. 
This 
system 
composes 
a 
regulator 
contract 
and 
a 
trial 
contract 
responsible 
for 
different 
trial-related 
processes. 
The 
authors 
in 
[90] 
perform 
a 
simulation 
onto 
a 
proof-of-concept 
web 
portal 
service 
with 
raw 
data 
collected 
from 
a 
completed 
clinical 
trial. 
The 
results 
indicate 
that 
the 
proposed 
service 
can 
improve 
trial 
data 
transparency 
to 
strengthen 
trust 
among 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
clinical 
research 
process. 
The 
advantages 
of 
applying 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trials, 
such 
as 
improving 
the 
development 
of 
trusted 
processes, 
gathering 
data, 
and 
reinforcing 
transparency, 
are 
discussed 
in 
[91]. 


4.2.4 


Regulatory 
compliance 


It 
is 
essential 
to 
follow 
guidelines 
set 
by 
regulatory 
authorities 
to 
protect 
the 
wellbeing 
of 
the 
patients 
involved 
in 
the 
clinical 
trial. 
The 
FDA 
is 
generally 
responsible 
for 
conducting 
random 
visits 
to 
the 
clinical 
sites. 
Once 
a 
study 
protocol 
is 
approved, 
it 
is 
not 
easy 
to 
track 
the 
activities 
of 
participating 
sites 
and 
ensure 
that 
they 
comply 
with 
the 
required 
guidelines 
[92]. 
The 
smart 
contract 
on 
the 
blockchain 
is 
a 
decentralized 
application 
that 
can 
capture 
these 
guidelines 
as 
a 
set 
of 
rules. 
It 
can 
ensure 
that 
all 
participants 
in 
the 
clinical 
trial 
follow 
a 
particular 
procedure 
in 
which 
no 
one 
is 
granted 
permission 
without 
the 
approval 
of 
related 
authorities. 
The 
first 
attempt 
to 
empirically 
test 
the 
blockchain-based 
approach 
using 
a 
publicly 
available 
clinical 
trial 
protocol 
is 
presented 
in 
[93]. 
The 
text 
of 
the 
study 
protocol 
is 
first 
transferred 
into 
SHA256 
digest 
and 
then 
converted 
into 
a 
bitcoin 
private 
key 
and 
public 
key. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
document’s 
existence 
can 
be 
proved 
with 
the 
bitcoin 
address. 
The 
authors 
in 
[94] 
present 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain-based 
data 
management 
framework 
in 
a 
multi-site 
study. 
The 
smart 
contract 
is 
utilized 
to 
enforce 
the 
rules 
of 
IRB-related 
regulatory 
requirements 
across 
multiple 
sites 
and 
stakeholders. 
A 
similar 
approach 
is 
proposed 
in 
[95] 
to 
tackle 
regulatory 
compliance 
challenges 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
Ethereum-based 
smart 
contracts 
capture 
three 
stages 
of 
a 
trial 
process, 
including 
new 
drug 
application, 
clinical 
trial 
initiation, 
and 
patient 
enrollment. 


4.3 


Blockchain 
types 


Blockchain 
is 
now 
being 
used 
by 
companies 
in 
different 
industries 
with 
different 
systems 
and 
processes. 
Different 
types 
of 
blockchain 
networks 
have 
different 
technical 
specifications. 
An 
essential 
task 
for 
business 
managers 
is 
to 
know 
which 
blockchain 
site 
is 
suitable 
for 
their 
business. 
As 
described 
in 
Figure 
7, 
the 
blockchain 
can 
be 
divided 
into 
public, 
private, 
and 
consortium 
chains 
according 
to 
the 
access 
condition. 
The 
former 
is 
permissionless 
blockchain, 
and 
the 
latter 
two 
are 
permissioned 
blockchain. 
A 
public 
chain 
refers 
to 
a 
blockchain 
that 
any 
participating 
node 
can 
access. 
The 
transaction 
can 
be

Overview 
of 
three 
types 
of 
blockchain 


effectively 
confirmed, 
and 
anyone 
can 
participate 
in 
its 
consensus 
process. 
Public 
chains 
usually 
apply 
to 
virtual 
currency, 
e-commerce 
for 
the 
public, 
Internet 
finance, 
and 
other 
Business 
to 
Consumer 
(B2C), 
Consumer 
to 
Consumer 
(C2C), 
or 
Consumer 
to 
Business 
(C2B) 
application 
scenarios. 
Due 
to 
its 
open 
nature, 
public 
chains 
must 
be 
protected 
with 
inherent 
cryptography 
to 
incentivize 
extravagant 
mining 
or 
fuel 
transaction 
processing 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
lack 
of 
privacy. 
A 
negative 
association 
exists 
between 
the 
usage 
of 
native 
digital 
currencies 
and 
the 
transaction 
cost 
and 
speed 
as 
a 
whole 
[96]. 


In 
addition, 
it 
complicates 
communication 
with 
other 
decentralized 
systems 
since 
the 
tokens 
used 
on 
each 
platform 
must 
be 
the 
same. 
Bitcoin, 
a 
well-known 
public 
blockchain 
system, 
is 
limited 
to 
7 
transactions 
per 
second, 
making 
it 
incapable 
of 
handling 
high-frequency 
trading 
[97]. 
A 
private 
chain 
is 
an 
organization 
or 
institution 
that 
controls 
a 
blockchain 
whose 
writing 
rights 
and 
participating 
nodes’ 
eligibility 
are 
strictly 
limited. 
The 
application 
scenarios 
of 
the 
private 
chain 
are 
generally 
internal 
applications 
of 
enterprises, 
such 
as 
database 
management 
and 
auditing. 
There 
are 
also 
applications 
in 
government 
industries, 
such 
as 
government 
budgeting 
and 
execution 
or 
government 
industry 
statistics, 
which 
are 
generally 
registered 
by 
the 
government 
but 
monitored 
by 
the 
public. 
The 
value 
of 
a 
private 
chain 
is 
mainly 
to 
provide 
a 
safe, 
traceable, 
non-tamper, 
automatic 
operation 
platform 
that 
simultaneously 
prevents 
internal 
and 
external 
security 
attacks 
on 
data. 
A 
consortium 
chain 
is 
a 
blockchain 
managed 
by 
several 
institutions, 
each 
of 
which 
runs 
one 
or 
more 
nodes. 
Data 
only 
allows 
different 
institutions 
within 
the 
system 
to 
read, 
write, 
send 
transactions, 
and 
record 
transaction 
data 
together. 
The 
confirmation 
time 
and 
the 
number 
of 
transactions 
per 
second 
of 
a 
consortium 
chain 
are 
pretty 
different 
from 
that 
of 
a 
public 
chain, 
and 
the 
requirements 
for 
security 
and 
performance 
are 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
a 
public 
chain. 
Compared 
with 
the 
public 
chain, 
the 
consortium 
chain 
can 
be 
regarded 
as 
partially 
decentralized, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
because 
of 
the 
reduced 
number 
of 
nodes, 
it 
can 
have 
faster 
transaction 
speed 
and 
lower 
costs.

Concept 
of

algorithm 


are 
faster, 
more 
energy-efficient, 
and 
less 
complicated 
to 
construct 
than 
public 
blockchains. 
However, 
research 
examining 
and 
enhancing 
the 
performance 
of 
blockchains 
is 
less 
in-depth 
and 
comprehensive. 
According 
to 
findings 
in 
[98], 
the 
performance 
of 
blockchains 
may 
begin 
to 
rival 
that 
of 
traditional 
databases 
for 
small 
systems. 
Nevertheless, 
consistent 
models 
and 
setup 
changes 
may 
significantly 
impact 
the 
final 
product’s 
performance. 


Consensus 
algorithms 


Unlike 
conventional 
transactions, 
which 
require 
a 
trusted 
third 
party 
to 
act 
as 
an 
intermediary, 
blockchain 
technology 
can 
decentralize 
transactions 
while 
ensuring 
data 
consistency 
across 
the 
network, 
making 
peer-to-peer 
transactions 
possible. 
This 
requires 
the 
design 
of 
the 
transaction 
confirmation 
rule, 
which 
is 
the 
consensus 
algorithm. 
As 
shown 
in 
Figure 
8, 
blockchain 
systems 
are 
decentralized 
in 
design, 
with 
nodes 
scattered 
and 
independent 
of 
each 
other. 
The 
system 
made 
up 
of 
different 
nodes 
must 
rely 
on 
a 
system 
to 
maintain 
data 
consistency. 
As 
the 
core 
of 
blockchain 
technology, 
the 
consensus 
algorithm 
plays 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
the 
security 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
blockchain. 
This 
subsection 
overviews 
some 
popular 
blockchain 
consensus 
algorithms 
and 
makes 
comparisons 
of 
these 
algorithms, 
as 
described 
in 
Table 
5. 


4.4.1 


PoW 


The 
PoW 
is 
the 
first 
widely 
used 
consensus 
algorithm 
used 
in 
Bitcoin 
networks. 
Its 
core 
is 
that 
nodes 
compete 
for 
accounting 
rights 
and 
Bitcoin 
rewards 
through 
computing 
power. 
In 
PoW, 
different 
nodes 
compete 
to 
solve 
a 
mathematical 
problem 
based 
on 
specific 
information. 
This 
mathematical 
problem 
is 
challenging 
to 
solve, 
but 
it 
is 
easy 
to 
verify 
the 
results. 
The 
node 
that 
solves 
this 
mathematical 
problem 
can 
create 
the 
next 
block 
and 
get 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
currency 
reward. 
Satoshi 
Nakamoto 
adopted 
the 
mathematical 
problem 
of 
HashCash 
[99] 
mechanism 
design 
in 
Bitcoin. 
PoW 
is 
based 
on 
computing 
power 
as 
the 
basis 
of 
competing 
accounting 
rights, 
the 
workload 
as 
the 
guarantee 
of 
security, 
and 
all 
miners 
follow 
the 
most 
extended 
chain 
principle. 
However, 
one 
of 
the 
limitations 
of 
PoW 
is 
its 
high 
requirement 
for 
computing 
power 
to 
validate 
transactions, 
thus 
leading 
to 
inefficiency. 
Besides, 
it 
is 
also 
reported 
that 
PoW 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
51% 
attacks 
[100]. 


4.4.2 


PoS 


As 
more 
and 
more 
people 
participate 
in 
Bitcoin 
mining, 
many 
problems 
of 
PoW 
gradually 
emerge. 
For 
example, 
with 
the 
rapid 
increase 
of 
competition 
for 
computing 
power, 
the 
energy 
consumed 
to 
obtain 
replacement 
coins 
increases 
significantly. 
The 
accounting 
rights 
are 
gradually 
concentrated 
in 
the 
“mining 
pool” 
with 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
computing 
power 
[101–102]. 
To 
this 
end, 
researchers 
try 
to 
adopt 
a 
new 
mechanism 
to 
replace 
the 
proof 
of 
workload. 
The 
concept 
of 
Proof 
of 
Stake 
(PoS) 
was 
mentioned 
in 
the 
earliest 
Bitcoin 
projects 
but 
was 
not 
used 
for 
reasons 
such 
as 
robustness. 
PoS 
puts 
forward 
the 
concept 
of 
coin 
age, 
which 
is 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
product 
of 
the 
token 
held 
and 
the 
holding 
time. 
Using 
coin 
age 
competition 
instead 
of 
computing 
power 
competition, 
the 
proof 
of 
blockchain 
is 
no 
longer 
only 
dependent 
on 
workload, 
which 
effectively 
solves 
the 
problem 
of 
PoW 
resource 
waste. 
The 
key 
advantages 
of 
PoS 
are 
higher 
transaction 
processing 
capability 
and 
lower 
energy 
consumption 
compared 
to 
PoW. 
However, 
despite 
many 
apparent

4.4.3 


DPoS 


In 
the 
blockchain, 
using 
the 
DPoS 
algorithm, 
each 
node 
can 
vote 
to 
select 
representatives 
according 
to 
its 
share 
rights 
and 
interests 
[104]. 
In 
the 
whole 
network, 
the 
nodes 
that 
participate 
in 
the 
election 
get 
the 
most 
votes 
to 
get 
the 
right 
to 
account, 
produce 
blocks 
in 
a 
predetermined 
order, 
and 
get 
certain 
rewards. 
The 
successful 
delegate 
node 
must 
pay 
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
deposit 
and 
be 
online 
for 
a 
certain 
period. 
If 
the 
node 
that 
should 
generate 
the 
block 
does 
not 
perform 
its 
duties 
at 
some 
point, 
it 
will 
be 
disqualified 
from 
the 
delegate, 
and 
the 
system 
will 
continue 
to 
vote 
for 
a 
new 
delegate 
to 
replace 
it. 
All 
nodes 
in 
DPoS 
can 
choose 
the 
voting 
objects 
independently, 
and 
the 
elected 
representatives 
keep 
accounts 
in 
order, 
saving 
computing 
resources 
compared 
with 
PoW 
and 
PoS 
[105]. 
Moreover, 
there 
are 
only 
a 
few 
consensus 
nodes, 
and 
the 
efficiency 
is 
also 
improved. 
In 
addition, 
each 
participating 
node 
has 
the 
right 
to 
vote. 
Despite 
these 
advantages, 
DPOS 
is 
widely 
suspected 
of 
being 
partially 
decentralized, 
and 
there 
is 
artificial 
operation 
space 
to 
control 
the 
election 
process 
of 
agent 
nodes. 


4.4.4 


PBFT 


In 
the 
PBFT 
algorithm, 
all 
nodes 
run 
in 
the 
same 
configuration, 
with 
a 
primary 
node, 
and 
other 
nodes 
serve 
as 
backup 
nodes 
[106]. 
The 
primary 
node 
is 
responsible 
for 
sorting 
client 
requests 
and 
sending 
them 
to 
the 
backup 
node 
in 
the 
sequence. 
The 
main 
advantages 
of 
PBFT 
are 
that 
it 
has 
lower 
energy 
demand 
than 
PoW, 
and 
its 
transactions 
do 
not 
require 
multiple 
confirmations. 
PBFT 
is 
a 
promising 
solution 
only 
when 
a 
small 
group 
of 
nodes 
is 
involved. 
However, 
it 
becomes 
inefficient 
in 
the 
case 
of 
large 
networks. 
PBFT 
algorithm 
is 
first 
adopted 
by 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain, 
namely 
Hyperledger 
Fabric. 
The 
functions 
of 
authorization 
and 
endorsement 
are 
integrated 
into 
consensus 
nodes. 
Such 
a 
design 
results 
in 
the 
overloading 
of 
nodes, 
which 
significantly 
impacts 
transaction 
processing 


capability 
and 
scalability. 
Some 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
PBFT; 
for 
instance, 
the 
Tendermint 
algorithm 
[107] 
used 
in 
the 
Cosmos 
project 
combined 
PBFT 
and 
PoS 
algorithm 
and 
selected 
part 
of 
consensus 
nodes 
for 
BFT 
consensus 
by 
the 
token 
mortgage, 
which 
weakened 
the 
asynchronous 
assumption 
and 
integrated 
the 
concept 
of 
lock 
based 
on 
PBFT. 
Consensus 
nodes 
could 
reach 
consensus 
through 
two-stage 
communication 
in 
the 
partially 
synchronous 
network. 
Based 
on 
Tendermint, 
Hotstuff 
[108] 
integrates 
the 
blockchain 
structure 
with 
each 
stage 
of 
Byzantine 
fault 
tolerance 
(BFT), 
confirms 
the 
signature 
of 
the 
previous 
block, 
and 
constructs 
the 
new 
block 
simultaneously 
between 
nodes 
in 
each 
stage, 
making 
the 
algorithm 
simpler 
to 
implement. 


4.4.5 


Raft 


The 
most 
commonly 
used 
consensus 
algorithm 
in 
traditional 
distributed 
systems 
is 
based 
on 
Paxos 
[109]. 
This 
kind 
of 
algorithm 
can 
quickly 
complete 
data 
synchronization 
of 
a 
distributed 
system 
under 
the 
condition 
of 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
nodes 
and 
relative 
trust 
and 
tolerate 
Crash 
Fault. 
In 
other 
words, 
in 
the 
traditional 
distributed 
system, 
there 
is 
no 
need 
to 
consider 
participating 
in 
malicious 
data 
tampering 
and 
other 
behaviours 
of 
nodes, 
but 
only 
need 
to 
tolerate 
the 
failure 
of 
some 
nodes. 
However, 
the 
Paxos 
algorithm 
is 
too 
theoretical 
and 
difficult 
to 
understand 
and 
implement. 
Raft 
algorithm 
was 
proposed 
in 
2013[110], 
it 
has 
the 
same 
effect 
as 
Paxos 
and 
is 
more 
convenient 
for 
engineering 
implementation. 
The 
leader 
is 
dominant 
in 
Raft, 
and 
the 
server 
nodes 
must 
be 
secure. 
Many 
permissioned 
chains 
use 
Raft 
algorithms 
to 
improve 
consensus 
efficiency 
without 
considering 
BFT. 
However, 
despite 
many 
apparent 
advantages, 
the 
transaction 
volume 
of 
Raft 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
maximum 
throughput 
of 
the 
node. 
Besides, 
the 
leader 
can 
cause 
significant 
damage 
if 
a 
malicious 
node 
takes 
over. 


4.4.6 


PoI 


When 
the 
PoI 
algorithm 
runs, 
nodes 
need 
to 
provide 
their 
importance 
to 
get 
the 
right 
to 
generate 
a 
new 
block 
[111].

held

is 
no 
longer 
the 
main 
factor 
of 
importance 
but 
the 
volume 
of 
transactions 
at 
nodes 
and 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
two 
parties. 
The 
node’s 
importance 
is 
evaluated 
according 
to 
the 
wallet’s 
transaction 
times 
and 
monetary 
assets. 
However, 
the 
agreement 
may 
encourage 
the 
nodes 
to 
collude 
in 
trading 
volume, 
and 
the 
frequent 
trading 
of 
large 
asset 
nodes 
may 
also 
cause 
the 
problem 
of 
centralization 
of 
importance. 


4.4.7 


RPCA 


There 
are 
currently 
several 
feasible 
solutions 
to 
the 
Byzantine 
general 
problem, 
such 
as 
the 
POW 
algorithm 
used 
by 
Bitcoin 
and 
Ethereum 
and 
the 
PBFT 
algorithm 
used 
by 
Hyperledger. 
However, 
consensus 
efficiency 
is 
relatively 
low 
in 
this 
distributed 
payment 
system 
due 
to 
the 
synchronous 
communication 
between 
nodes. 
In 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
synchronous 
communication, 
a 
scheme 
of 
mutual 
trust 
within 
the 
sub-network 
is 
adopted 
in 
the 
RPCA 
algorithm 
[112]. 
These 
internal 
trusted 
sub-networks 
form 
an 
extensive 
network. 
The 
trust 
cost 
of 
the 
sub-network 
is 
meager 
and 
can 
be 
further 
reduced 
to 
the 
atomic 
selection 
of 
network 
nodes 
for 
other 
nodes 
in 
the 
sub-network. 
In 
addition, 
to 
maintain 
the 
data 
consistency 
of 
nodes 
on 
the 
whole 
network, 
the 
connection 
degree 
between 
sub-networks 
must 
not 
be 
less 
than 
a 
threshold. 
RPCA 
can 
be 
a 
high 
Byzantine 
fault 
tolerance 
algorithm 
with 
high 
performance 
through 
these 
solutions. 
The 
RPCA 
algorithm 
has 
been 
applied 
to 
the 
Ripple 
consensus 
protocol.

Deployment 
methods 


Blockchain 
is 
an 
underlying 
technology 
architecture 
system 
that 
overturns 
the 
existing 
pattern. 
The 
deployment 
of 
a 
blockchain 
system 
involves 
establishing 
hardware, 
software, 
and 
other 
tools 
and 
technical 
environments. 
This 
subsection 
describes 
the 
current 
methods 
to 
deploy 
a 
blockchain 
system. 


4.5.1 


Cloud-based 


While 
blockchain 
technology 
expands 
beyond 
Bitcoin, 
cloud 
computing 
undergoes 
a 
paradigm 
change 
to 
satisfy 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
fourth 
industrial 
revolution 
[113]. 
As 
seen 
in 
Figure 
9, 
Blockchain-as-a-Service 
(BaaS) 
refers 
to 
the 
cloud-based 
development, 
management, 
hosting, 
and 
use 
of 
blockchain 
technologies 
such 
as 
apps, 
nodes, 
smart 
contracts, 
and 
distributed 
ledger. 
This 
kind 
of 
cloud-based 
solution 
supports 
blockchain 
installation, 
platform, 
security, 
and 
other 
characteristics. 
Thus, 
BaaS 
presents 
the 
blockchain 
service 
platform, 
which 
supports 
basic 
features 
based 
on 
cloud 
computing 
infrastructure 
and 
a 
unified 
development 
environment 
for 
both 
developers 
and 
users. 
Microsoft 
Azure, 
IBM 
Cloud, 
Amazon 
Web 
Services 
(AWS), 
Oracle 
Cloud, 
and 
HP 
Helion 
are 
currently 
popular 
cloud 
platforms 
that 
support 
the 
infrastructure 
and 
software 
to 
deploy 
a 
complete 
blockchain 
application, 
as 
discussed 
in 
[114]. 
However, 
such 
blockchain 
system 
is 
generally

overview 
of 
BaaS-based 
blockchain 
deployment 


controlled 
by 
large 
companies 
or 
institutions, 
which 
has 
a 
high 
risk 
of 
user 
data 
and 
user 
data 
being 
stolen. 
Moreover, 
the 
reliability 
requirement 
of 
the 
cloud 
platform 
is 
lower 
than 
that 
of 
the 
blockchain. 
The 
reliability 
of 
the 
blockchain 
system 
running 
on 
the 
cloud 
platform 
is 
insufficient. 


4.5.2 


Container-based 


The 
cloud 
computing 
paradigm 
is 
based 
on 
virtualization, 
enabling 
numerous 
virtual 
machines 
to 
coexist 
on 
a 
single 
physical 
device 
to 
enable 
scaling 
up 
and 
down 
of 
applications 
via 
elastic 
provisioning 
on 
demand 
[115]. 
Recent 
containers, 
such 
as 
Docker, 
have 
allowed 
a 
lighter 
mechanism 
than 
hypervisors 
and 
established 
themselves 
as 
a 
viable 
alternative 
to 
virtualization 
based 
on 
shared 
operating 
systems. 
Figure 
10 
illustrates 
the 
high-level 
architecture 
of 
Docker-based 
blockchain 
deployment. 
Most 
blockchain 
software 
is 
a 
high-level 
application 
requiring 
complex 
configuration, 
which 
would 
not 
have 
been 
friendly 
for 
ordinary 
users. 
On 
this 
basis, 
put 
the 
blockchain 
software 
into 
the 
container, 
and 
make 
the 
system 
send 
container 
rather 
than 
send 
data. 
Thus, 
the 
container 
that 
includes 
the 
blockchain 
software 
is 
sent 
to 
the 
client 
to 
form 
the 
blockchain 
system. 
If 
the 
blockchain 
container 
is 
delivered, 
the 
software 
in 
it 
is 
taken 
out 
of 
the 
blockchain 
container 
and 
deployed 
on 
a 
local 
server. 
This 
container 
technology 
is 
only 
a 
communication 
technology 
and 
does 
not 
have 
the 
function 
of 
protecting 
software 
and 
data 
in 
the 
container. 
In 
addition, 
in 
such 
a 
deployment 
model, 
the 
local 
blockchain 
software 
may 
be 
modified, 
and 
cannot 
be 
controlled, 
leading 
to 
a 
risk 
of 
tampering. 
Many 
types 
of 
research 
have 
been 
investigated 
using 
container 
technology 
to 
deploy 
blockchain 
systems, 
but 
most 
keep 
the 
blockchain 
code

The

is 
executed 
in 
the 
container, 
but 
there 
may 
be 
issues 
in 
the

process,

DEVELOPMENT 
TRENDS 
OF 
BLOCKCHAIN 
APPLICATIONS 
IN 
CLINICAL 
TRIALS 


Deploying 
blockchain 
in 
the 
context 
of 
clinical 
trials 
could 
ease 
the 
development 
of 
transparent 
and 
highly 
dependable 
trials, 
improve 
patient 
recruitment, 
achieve 
complete 
decentralization, 
assisting 
regulatory 
compliance, 
and 
promote 
integration. 
It 
is 
a 
unique 
technology 
that 
offers 
robust 
governance 
and 
real-time 
choices 
regardless 
of 
geographic 
distance. 
The 
blockchainbased 
system 
could 
increase 
the 
data 
exchange 
process’s 
integrity 
and 
trustworthiness 
while 
decreasing 
transaction 
costs. 
As 
a 
result, 
different 
companies 
are 
using 
it 
to 
build 
secure 
data 
and 
service 
management 
systems 
in 
intelligent 
healthcare. 
For 
example, 
IBM 
Watson 
Health 
has 
signed 
a 
joint-development 
agreement 
with 
the 
FDA 
to 
explore 
blockchain 
technology 
to 
exchange 
patient 
data, 
including 
EMRs, 
genomic 
data, 
and 
clinical 
trials 
[117]. 
Besides, 
DeepMind 
has 
announced 
it 
will 
utilize 
a 
decentralized 
ledger 
to 
build 
a 
real-time 
data 
audit 
platform 
for 
personal 
health 
records 
[118]. 
This 
section 
outlines 
and 
discusses 
the 
recent 
development 
trend 
of 
blockchain 
applications 
in 
clinical 
trials. 


5.1 


Clinical 
trials 
intelligence 


The 
Clinical 
Trials 
Intelligence 
founded 
by 
ClinTex, 
is 
a 
distributed 
technology 
platform 
that 
incorporates 
predictive 
data 
analytics, 
machine 
learning, 
and 
the 
innovative 
use 
of 
smart 
contracts 
to 
drive 
significant 
quality 
and 
operational 
improvements 
in 
clinical 
trials 
[119]. 
This 
platform 
is 
the 
first 
blockchainbased 
clinical 
trial 
ecosystem 
targeted 
to 
address 
the 
critical 
pain 


points 
of 
clinical 
trials, 
including 
operational 
excellence, 
predictive 
data 
analytics, 
site 
investigators, 
patient 
recruitment, 
vendor 
management, 
risk 
monitoring, 
and 
clinical 
data 
visualization. 
Clinical 
Trials 
Intelligence 
utilizes 
Ethereum-based 
smart 
contracts 
to 
facilitate 
access 
control, 
compensation 
payments, 
and 
clinical 
data 
hash 
storage. 
ChainLink 
is 
a 
decentralized 
oracle 
provider 
that 
allows 
smart 
contracts 
to 
access 
data 
from 
various 
resources. 
In 
Clinical 
Trials 
Intelligence, 
Storj 
is 
the 
decentralized 
storage 
provider 
for 
encrypted 
clinical 
data. 
Besides, 
it 
releases 
its 
native 
token, 
CTi, 
for 
the 
cost 
of 
data 
access 
and 
as 
payment 
for 
investigators 
and 
third 
parties. 
ClinTex 
has 
already 
partnered 
with 
Intellimed 
to 
deploy 
the 
Clinical 
Trials 
Intelligence 
in 
academic 
clinical 
research 
settings. 
Further 
demand 
will 
derive 
from 
ClinTex’s 
publicizing 
its 
partnerships 
with 
some 
of 
the 
biggest 
names 
in 
the 
pharmaceutical 
industry. 


5.2 


TriNetX 


TriNetX 
is 
a 
global 
health 
research 
network 
that 
aims 
to 
make 
clinical 
research 
easy 
and 
efficient 
by 
sharing 
real-world 
data 
among 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
to 
various 
trial-related 
participants, 
such 
as 
study 
sites 
and 
investigators 
to 
patients. 
In 
2017, 
TriNetX 
cooperated 
with 
the 
West 
Virginia 
Clinical 
and 
Translational 
Science 
Institute 
(WVCTSI) 
to 
increase 
investigators’ 
access 
to 
trial 
opportunities 
and 
broaden 
research 
capabilities 
[120]. 
The 
TriNetX 
platform 
is 
built 
on 
blockchain, 
enabling 
WVCTSI 
researchers 
to 
access 
real-world 
data 
from 
more 
than 
40 
health 
organizations. 
The 
healthcare 
organizations 
part 
of 
the 
TriNetX 
platform 
provides 
their 
data 
through 
a 
live, 
federated 
model 
so 
that 
new 
observations, 
results, 
and 
medication 
orders 
are 
available 
monthly. 
These 
healthcare 
organizations 
represent 
renowned 
academic 
medical 
centres 
and 
public 
or 
private 
hospitals, 
representing 
all 
four 
U.S. 
census 
regions 
and 
patients 
of 
all 
demographics. 
Besides, 
this 
platform 
provides 
power 
logic 
to 
support 
a 
full 
range 
query 
on 
medical 
codes 
and 
advanced 
analytics 
tools 
to 
quantify 
the 
impact 
of

work 
potential, 
real-time 
intelligence, 
and 
discovery 
of 
new 
patterns 
across 
all 
phases 
of 
drug 
development. 
Blockchain 
is 
designed 
for 
customers 
who 
rely 
on 
distributed 
but 
private 
communication. 
In 
addition, 
blockchain 
is 
data-sensitive 
and 
ensures 
secure 
communication 
between 
selected 
participants 
through 
compliance 
with 
General 
Data 
Protection 
Regulation 
(GDPR). 


5.4 


Triall 


The 
clinical 
trial 
software 
market 
is 
growing 
due 
to 
the 
digitization 
and 
globalization 
of 
clinical 
research. 
Industry 
stakeholders 
are 
currently 
switching 
from 
general-purpose 
solutions 
to 
advanced, 
dedicated 
applications. 
Triall 
is 
building 
the 
world’s 
first 
blockchain-enabled 
clinical 
research 
ecosystem, 
providing 
services 
and 
connections 
to 
all 
people 
involved 
in 
clinical 
trials 
[122]. 
Triall 
aims 
to 
leverage 
blockchain 
technology’s 
benefits 
to 
enhance 
value 
truly, 
thereby 
promoting 
trust, 
research 
data 
integrity, 
auditability, 
and 
system 
interoperability. 
This 
is 
all 
part 
of 
an 
effort 
to 
address 
these 
persistent 
problems 
that 
make 
medical 
innovation 
too 
complex, 
tedious, 
and 
resource-inefficient. 
Triall 
envisions 
the 
world’s 
first 
online 
environment 
available 
to 
all 
clinical 
research 
professionals, 
regardless 
of 
function, 
type 
of 
organization, 
or 
level 
of 
resource. 
The 
adoption 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
renders 
clinical 
trial 
data 
tamper-proof. 
Triall 
strives 
to 
protect 
clinical 
trial 
data 
by 
increasing 
all 
stakeholders’ 
quality, 
efficiency, 
compliance, 
and 
confidence. 


5.5 


Embleema 


Embleema 
is 
another 
service 
that 
aids 
healthcare 
practitioners 
in 
constructing 
clinical 
trials, 
including 
patient 
recruiting 
and 
study 
design 
[123]. 
Embleema 
has 
created 
a 
virtual 
research 
suite 
for 
intuitive 
and 
traceable 
design. 
This 
platform 
gathers, 
analyzes, 
and 
organizes 
clinical 
and 
real-time 
global 
data 
with 
total 
user 
control, 
from 
patient 
recruiting 
through 
regulatory 
submission. 
Embleema 
restores 
accuracy 
and 
transparency 
to 
the 
healthcare 
and 
clinical 
trial 
industry 
by 
allowing 
patients 
to 
merge 
with 
healthcare 
stakeholders, 
which 
own 
and 
directly 
share 
their 
data, 
and 
be 
compensated 
with 
cryptocurrency 
tokens. 
The 
project 
proposes 
using 
wearable 
devices 
to 
attach 
data 
on 
the 
blockchain 
to 
ensure 
that 
real 
data 
is 
collected 


from 
real 
patients 
and 
give 
patients 
complete 
control 
over 
their 
medical 
data.

CURRENT 
MICRO 
APPLICATIONS 
IN 
CLINICAL 
TRIALS 


Blockchain 
is 
regarded 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
enhancing 
clinical 
research 
techniques 
and 
a 
step 
toward 
achieving 
more 
openness 
to 
increase 
confidence 
among 
research 
organizations, 
clinical 
sites, 
and 
patient 
populations. 
The 
adoption 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
healthcare 
offers 
several 
advantages, 
including 
safe 
data 
monitoring 
and 
sharing, 
data 
availability, 
and 
user 
privacy. 
This 
section 
overviews 
some 
recent 
efforts 
on 
blockchain-based 
micro 
applications 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
clinical 
trials. 


6.1 


Virtual 
clinical 
trials 


Virtual 
clinical 
trials 
(VCT) 
are 
a 
relatively 
new 
method 
for 
conducting 
clinical 
studies 
primarily 
through 
digital 
health 
platforms 
to 
make 
subject 
involvement 
transparent 
[124]. 
Blockchain 
is 
a 
peer-to-peer 
network 
that 
does 
not 
need 
the 
administration 
of 
a 
third 
party 
and 
relies 
on 
the 
consensus 
of 
all 
users. 
Before 
entering 
the 
system 
under 
the 
VCT 
scenario, 
stakeholders 
such 
as 
clinical 
trial 
sponsors 
and 
sites 
must 
verify 
their 
identities 
with 
the 
FDA. 
This 
protects 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
all 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
private 
chain. 
All 
blockchain 
transactions 
are 
publicly 
auditable 
by 
all 
blockchain 
users. 
This 
functionality 
may 
guarantee 
that 
users 
of 
the 
private 
blockchain 
developed 
for 
VCTs 
get 
all 
recruitment-related 
data 
[125]. 


The 
use 
of 
the 
original 
blockchain 
to 
VCTs 
may 
preserve 
data 
security 
and 
patient 
privacy, 
assure 
data 
consistency, 
and 
make 
information 
accessible 
to 
all 
users. 
The 
Ethereum 
blockchain 
retains 
all 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
original 
blockchain 
and 
adds 
smart 
contracts, 
making 
it 
more 
appropriate 
for 
healthcare 
applications. 
A 
smart 
contract 
is 
a 
mechanism 
that 
automatically 
executes 
on 
the 
blockchain 
to 
control 
transactions. 
Since 
Solidity 
is 
used 
to 
create 
Ethereum 
smart 
contracts, 
any 
computational 
challenge 
may 
be 
solved. 
For 
instance, 
a 
data 
analytics 
tool 
may 
be 
included 
in 
the 
smart 
contract 
to 
identify 
abnormalities 
in 
real-time 
throughout 
the 
VCT. 
Sponsors 
or 
the 
VCT 
authority 
(such 
as 
the 
FDA) 
can 
guarantee 
that 
patients 
get 
prompt 
medical 
care. 


6.2 


Dynamic 
consent 
management 


In 
contrast 
to 
the 
present 
literature, 
there 
are 
very 
few 
real 
clinical 
studies 
using 
blockchain 
for 
the 
dynamic 
consent 
process. 
In 
addition, 
dynamic 
consent 
problems 
have 
been 
highlighted, 
including 
data 
readability 
and 
accessibility 
[126]. 
The 
authors 
of 


[127] 
constructed 
a 
blockchain-based 
architecture 
for 
dynamic 
consent 
and 
tested 
its 
real-world 
viability 
by 
using 
virtual 
drugs 
in 
a 
decentralized, 
multicentre 
clinical 
trial. 
Throughout 
the 
research, 
two 
major 
and 
three 
minor 
protocol 
adjustments 
were 
planned 
to 
imitate 
real-world 
study 
conditions. 
The 
platform 

2388 


HANG 
ET 
AL. 


included 
a 
web 
and 
application-based 
user 
interface 
for 
consenting 
subjects. 
To 
optimize 
the 
simplicity 
of 
the 
permission 
procedure, 
we 
built 
a 
distinct 
user 
interface 
for 
subjects 
and 
researchers. 
After 
authentication, 
each 
subject 
browsed 
the 
website 
or 
application 
and 
created 
a 
user 
account. 
The 
platform 
was 
then 
granted 
access 
to 
the 
confirmed 
user. 
Hyperledger 
Fabric, 
an 
enterprise-grade 
private 
blockchain 
architecture, 
was 
used 
to 
create 
the 
blockchain 
component. 
This 
was 
the 
first 
investigation 
to 
examine 
study 
adherence 
in 
a 
decentralized 
clinical 
trial 
using 
virtual 
drugs. 
As 
most 
decentralized 
clinical 
trials 
include 
home-based 
drug 
administration 
and 
remote 
monitoring, 
it 
is 
crucial 
to 
monitor 
medication 
behaviour 
accurately. 
The 
virtual 
drugs 
offered 
drug 
adherence 
monitoring 
with 
little 
expense 
and 
danger. 
This 
methodology 
may 
be 
extended 
to 
future 
investigations, 
such 
as 
remote 
drug 
administration. 


6.3 


Data 
validation 
and 
verification 
in 
a 
breast 
cancer 
clinical 
trial 


Due 
to 
the 
prevalence 
of 
misbehaviour 
in 
clinical 
trials 
and 
the 
significant 
amount 
of 
revenue 
and 
time 
used 
by 
existing 
source 
data 
verification 
processes, 
blockchain 
is 
a 
suitable 
technology 
application 
for 
the 
data 
management 
of 
clinical 
trials. 
The 
authors 
of 
[128] 
presented 
a 
blockchain-based 
solution 
for 
securing 
clinical 
trial 
medical 
data. 
The 
technology 
was 
used 
in 
a 
clinical 
study 
conducted 
at 
the 
National 
Cancer 
Center 
of 
Japan 
to 
examine 
the 
effects 
of 
home-based 
high-intensity 
interval 
training 
on 
breast 
cancer 
survivors. 
Under 
the 
regulatory 
sandbox 
of 
the 
Japanese 
Cabinet 
Office, 
the 
project 
was 
designed 
to 
showcase 
clinical 
data 
management 
utilizing 
blockchain 
technology. 
This 
sandbox 
enables 
enterprises 
to 
demonstrate 
and 
evaluate 
emerging 
technologies, 
such 
as 
blockchain 
and 
the 
Internet 
of 
Things, 
without 
being 
subject 
to 
current 
restrictions. 
It 
simultaneously 
enables 
future 
deregulatory 
actions. 
On 
August 
23, 
2019, 
they 
noticed 
an 
interruption 
of

During

they

that

OPEN 
RESEARCH 
CHALLENGES 


7.1 


Technical 
challenges 


Although 
all 
walks 
of 
life 
have 
optimistic 
expectations 
for 
blockchain 
applications, 
the 
real 
implementation 
still 
faces 
many 
technical 
challenges. 
The 
paradox 
of 
the 
ternary 
of 
blockchain, 
namely, 
efficiency, 
decentralization, 
and 
security, 
is 
the 
focus 
of 
many 
technical 
studies 
[129]. 
No 
project 
can 
simultaneously 
achieve 
the 
highest 
efficiency, 
decentralization, 
and 
security. 
It 
has 
always 
been 
the 
research 
direction 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
to 
explore 
the 
balance 
of 
the 
three 
and 
even 
explore 
the 
limits 
of 
Pareto 
improvement. 
This 
problem 
is 
the 
key 
to 
implement 


blockchain 
in 
all 
walks 
of 
life 
and 
is 
also 
universal 
to 
the 
medical 
industry. 


Blockchain 
is 
a 
decentralized 
structure 
where 
each 
node 
is 
independent 
of 
ledgers. 
The 
whole 
transaction 
can 
only 
be 
confirmed 
after 
each 
node 
of 
the 
whole 
network 
has 
been 
completed 
and 
reached 
a 
consensus, 
resulting 
in 
low 
transaction 
processing 
performance. 
Furthermore, 
a 
noticeable 
barrel 
effect 
is 
presented 
as 
the 
system’s 
overall 
performance 
depends 
on 
the 
block 
in 
the 
chain 
network 
node 
with 
the 
worst 
performance. 
The 
transaction 
throughput 
and 
latency 
have 
become 
critical 
bottlenecks 
hindering 
the 
implementation 
of 
blockchain 
application 
scenarios 
[80, 
130]. 
For 
example, 
the 
Bitcoin 
network 
can 
only 
process 
7 
transactions 
per 
second 
due 
to 
the 
block 
size 
limitation 
and 
the 
time 
needed 
to 
create 
a 
new 
block, 
rendering 
it 
unsuitable 
for 
trading 
with 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
change 
[131]. 
Ethereum 
takes 
about 
15 
seconds 
to 
complete 
a 
transaction, 
but 
the 
average 
time 
increases 
exponentially 
as 
network 
conditions 
change 
[132]. 
Scalability 
is 
a 
severe 
issue 
when 
creating 
blockchain 
systems 
in 
clinical 
trials 
as 
they 
cannot 
fulfil 
the 
requirement 
of 
processing 
a 
large 
volume 
of 
patient 
data 
in 
a 
real-time 
manner, 
which 
would 
result 
in 
generating 
a 
large 
number 
of 
transactions 
per 
second 
[86]. 


Most 
blockchains 
have 
incredibly 
high 
storage 
costs 
because 
they 
need 
to 
be 
stored 
on 
every 
node 
in 
the 
network 
and 
require 
a 
lot 
of 
computing 
power. 
For 
example, 
the 
use 
of 
PoW 
wastes 
computing 
resources. 
It 
has 
poor 
transaction 
performance, 
increasing 
the 
additional 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
costs 
and 
creating 
a 
massive 
obstacle 
to 
implement 
practical 
applications 
[133]. 
All 
clinical 
sites 
are 
required 
to 
offer 
specific 
computational 
resources 
for 
data 
mining. 
A 
security 
concern 
may 
occur 
if 
one 
party 
owns 
more 
than 
50% 
of 
computer 
resources. 
According 
to 
various 
clinical 
trial 
protocols, 
clinical 
sites 
may 
not 
disclose 
minor 
adverse 
events. 
In 
addition, 
with 
the 
increase 
in 
data 
volume, 
the 
information 
in 
the 
blockchain 
will 
show 
exponential 
growth, 
which 
puts 
forward 
higher 
requirements 
for 
storage 
space, 
download 
speed, 
and 
so 
on. 


7.2 


Security 
challenges 


Patient 
privacy 
data 
security 
is 
essential 
to 
information 
management 
for 
the 
medical 
industry. 
An 
essential 
feature 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
is 
that 
multiple 
nodes 
jointly 
maintain 
a 
set 
of 
data 
ledgers. 
All 
data 
in 
the 
ledger 
must 
be 
verified 
and 
stored 
by 
multiple 
nodes, 
exposing 
the 
issue 
of 
blockchain 
privacy 
protection. 
Therefore, 
blockchain 
information 
security 
and 
privacy 
protection 
is 
a 
research 
hotspot 
in 
this 
field 
[134]. 
Channel 
technology, 
zero-knowledge 
proof, 
homomorphic 
encryption 
technology, 
and 
other 
algorithms 
are 
constantly 
integrated 
with 
applications. 
Many 
technical 
solutions 
are 
in 
the 
continuous 
optimization 
and 
exploration 
stage. 


The 
smart 
contract 
is 
visible 
to 
all 
participating 
users 
in 
the 
blockchain 
network. 
This 
can 
cause 
various 
vulnerabilities, 
including 
security 
holes 
visible 
to 
users, 
and 
may 
not 
be 
quickly 
fixed. 
For 
instance, 
there 
was 
a 
massive 
loss 
in 
June 
2016 
due 
to 
the 
Decentralized 
Autonomous 
Organization 
(DAO) 
Ether

vulnerability 
[135]. 
Moreover, 
with 
the 
system’s 
business 
logic 
complexity, 
actions 
and 
results 
such 
as 
results 
audits 
and 
evaluations 
must 
be 
subject 
to 
subjective 
review. 
Without 
human 
intervention, 
assessing 
such 
activities 
through 
pre-written 
smart 
contracts 
is 
difficult. 


7.3 


Organizational 
challenges 


If 
the 
clinical 
trial 
blockchain 
system 
is 
widely 
promoted 
in 
clinical 
sites, 
all 
patients’ 
medical 
data 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
blockchain 
ledger. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
immutable 
nature 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
is 
a 
double-edged 
sword. 
Once 
the 
data 
is 
attached 
to 
the 
chain, 
it 
cannot 
be 
modified, 
making 
it 
impossible 
to 
modify 
health 
records 
even 
if 
there 
is 
a 
valid 
reason, 
such 
as 
a 
misentry 
due 
to 
human 
error. 
In 
complex 
data 
systems, 
data 
updates 
and 
modifications 
are 
inevitable, 
and 
no 
one 
can 
be 
sure 
that 
the 
original 
data 
uploaded 
to 
the 
blockchain 
is 
correct. 


The 
efficient 
and 
universal 
cross-chain 
technology 
is 
the 
key 
to 
realize 
all-chain 
interconnection. 
The 
ecological 
island 
phenomenon 
of 
blockchain 
is 
serious, 
which 
has 
become 
a 
difficulty 
affecting 
the 
overall 
expansion 
of 
blockchain. 
For 
example, 
the 
underlying 
architecture 
between 
platforms 
cannot 
communicate, 
the 
design 
difference 
is 
profound, 
the 
cross-chain 
data 
cannot 
be 
verified, 
the 
interface 
protocol 
cannot 
be 
interconnected, 
the 
security 
mechanism 
cannot 
trust 
each 
other, 
and 
the 
business 
layer 
cannot 
exchange 
visits. 
Establishing 
an 
interoperable 
blockchain 
platform 
is 
challenging 
due 
to 
various 
issues, 
including 
differences 
in 
consensus 
algorithms, 
token 
transfers, 
and 
programming 
languages 
[136]. 


8 


FUTURE 
RESEARCH 
DIRECTIONS 


In 
order 
to 
benefit 
more 
from 
blockchain 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
A 
number 
of 
research 
areas 
or 
technologies 
can 
be 
explored 
for 
future 
research 
and 
development. 
This 
section 
discusses 
several 
future 
research 
directions 
as 
follows: 


8.1 


Combination 
with 
AI 
and 
big 
data 


To 
a 
certain 
extent, 
blockchain 
technology 
solves 
the 
dilemma 
that 
medical 
information 
data 
is 
not 
flowing 
smoothly 
and 
all 
parties 
are 
mutually 
isolated 
data, 
avoiding 
the 
invariability 
caused 
by 
legal 
sensitivity 
of 
medical 
information 
in 
the 
past. 
Valid 
data 
recorded 
on 
the 
blockchain 
are 
accumulated 
into 
a 
massive 
database 
of 
higher 
quality. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
databased 
AI 
medicine 
research, 
and 
development 
paradigm 
has 
emerged 
with 
the 
development 
of 
big 
data 
and 
AI 
technology. 
It 
is 
essentially 
autonomous 
learning 
through 
machine 
data 
and 
data 
mining 
and 
sums 
up 
the 
drug 
development 
rule 
of 
expert 
experience 
and 
optimization 
of 
drug 
development. 
Through 
processing 
a 
large 
amount 
of 
high-quality 
medical 
big 
data, 
recurrent 
deep 
learning 
and 
algorithm 
optimization 
are 
carried 
out 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
AI 
in 
different 
areas, 
such 
as 


cases, 
images, 
and 
genes, 
and 
establish 
verifiable 
and 
repeatable 
medical 
standards. 
While 
advancing 
the 
development 
of 
medical 
science, 
AI 
also 
enables 
patients 
to 
consume 
standardized 
medical 
services 
no 
matter 
in 
and 
outside 
of 
the 
hospital. 


In 
recent 
years, 
AI 
has 
also 
made 
many 
significant 
achievements 
in 
medicine. 
For 
example, 
Insilico 
Medicine 
released 
the 
first 
candidate 
drug 
system 
using 
the 
Generative 
Adversarial 
Network 
(GAN) 
to 
develop 
in 
vivo 
activity 
and 
found 
a 
candidate 
drug 
in 
46 
days 
[137]. 
The 
results, 
published 
in 
Nature 
Biotechnology, 
have 
been 
cited 
as 
one 
of 
the 
milestones 
in 
the 
rise 
of 
AI 
pharmaceuticals, 
significantly 
reducing 
the 
time 
to 
drug 
development 
compared 
to 
traditional 
methods. 
AI 
has 
also 
been 
used 
to 
screen 
patients 
for 
clinical 
trials, 
such 
as 
Mendel 
Recruit, 
which 
uses 
natural 
language 
to 
scan 
documents 
and 
clinical 
records 
to 
screen 
eligible 
subjects 
24–50% 
more 
efficiently 
than 
conventional 
methods. 


8.2 


Promotion 
of 
unified 
data 
standards 


Interoperability 
and 
varying 
data 
standards 
are 
significant 
challenges 
that 
have 
vexed 
stakeholders 
for 
many 
years. 
As 
the 
current 
medical 
information 
data 
standards 
are 
not 
unified, 
sharing 
a 
large 
volume 
of 
medical 
information 
is 
difficult. 
The 
critical 
step 
to 
promoting 
medical 
information 
construction 
is 
unifying 
data 
standards. 
Along 
with 
advancing 
the 
national 
health 
insurance 
unit 
for 
health 
care 
reform, 
the 
current 
messy 
medical 
information 
data 
will 
gradually 
realize 
standardization 
and 
unification 
and 
be 
accepted 
by 
the 
parties. 
After 
that, 
the 
effect 
of 
information 
circulation 
realized 
by 
blockchain 
for 
the 
medical 
industry 
will 
be 
significantly 
improved. 
The 
industry’s 
efficiency 
will 
be 
further 
sublimated, 
and 
the 
construction 
and 
development 
of 
the 
medical 
system 
will 
be 
promoted. 


8.3 


Integration 
of 
regulators 
and 
industry 
associations 


After 
the 
multi-party 
medical 
alliance 
chain 
is 
gradually 
established, 
further 
integration 
is 
bound 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
to 
achieve 
greater 
synergy. 
However, 
due 
to 
the 
different 
architecture 
and 
interest 
demands 
of 
all 
parties, 
there 
will 
be 
many 
difficulties 
in 
the 
integration 
process. 
Industry 
regulatory 
agencies 
or 
associations 
may 
become 
the 
best 
role 
in 
promoting 
integration. 
Taking 
the 
hospital 
system 
as 
an 
example, 
the 
significant 
medical 
associations 
have 
difficulties 
in 
cooperation 
and 
alliance. 
The 
information 
between 
medical 
institutions 
can 
only 
be 
transferred 
within 
each 
medical 
association. 
Suppose 
the 
hospital 
associated 
with 
the 
right 
to 
speak 
in 
the 
industry 
initiates 
the 
alliance 
integration, 
proposes 
a 
unified 
standard, 
takes 
the 
initiative 
to 
cooperate, 
and 
builds 
a 
trans-regional 
and 
transsystem 
large-scale 
alliance 
chain. 
In 
that 
case, 
it 
can 
achieve 
a 
broader 
range 
of 
medical 
data 
sharing. 
After 
that, 
it 
can 
connect 
with 
insurance 
institutions, 
pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, 
and 
other 
institutions 
to 
promote 
the 
data 
circulation 
of 
the 
whole 
industrial 
chain 
and 
eventually 
create 
a 
complete 
blockchain 
ecosystem.

CONCLUSION 
REFERENCES 


As 
a 
new 
technology, 
blockchain 
provides 
a 
new 
perspective 
for 
breaking 
through 
the 
bottleneck 
of 
the 
development 
of 
clinical 
trial 
informatization 
with 
its 
decentralization, 
security 
sharing, 
non-tampering, 
and 
high 
privacy 
characteristics. 
This 
study 
provides 
a 
taxonomy 
that 
identifies 
the 
aspects 
of 
clinical 
trials 
that 
blockchain 
technology 
can 
benefit 
from. 
The 
taxonomy 
is 
separated 
into 
decentralized 
scenarios 
and 
practices, 
blockchain 
types, 
deployment 
methods, 
and 
consensus 
algorithms. 
The 
blockchain 
application 
can 
cover 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
clinical 
trial 
study, 
such 
as 
patient 
recruitment, 
consent 
traceability, 
persistent 
monitoring, 
data 
management, 
and 
data 
analysis, 
providing 
practical 
technical 
support 
for 
the 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
clinical 
trial 
informatization 
foundation 
and 
the 
process 
of 
reshaping 
clinical 
trial 
data 
management. 
Moreover, 
we 
outline 
recent 
development 
trends 
of 
blockchain 
projects 
and 
micro 
applications 
in 
clinical 
trials. 


Furthermore, 
the 
threats 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
utilization 
within 
clinical 
trials, 
including 
privacy 
leakage, 
scalability 
issues, 
security, 
and 
interoperability, 
are 
discussed 
in 
this 
paper. 
These 
technical 
difficulties 
are 
also 
relevant 
to 
implementing 
blockchain 
in 
the 
clinical 
trial 
study. 
Only 
by 
overcoming 
the 
core 
technical 
difficulties 
can 
the 
advantages 
and 
potential 
of 
blockchain 
technology 
be 
genuinely 
brought 
into 
play 
in 
clinical 
trials. 


Future 
clinical 
trials 
and 
decision 
support 
can 
be 
improved 
by 
integrating 
AI 
and 
big 
data 
technology. 
In 
addition, 
the 
promotion 
of 
unified 
data 
standards 
can 
facilitate 
the 
communication 
among 
different 
blockchain 
platforms, 
and 
the 
addition 
of 
integration 
of 
regulators 
and 
industry 
associations 
can 
promote 
the 
data 
circulation 
of 
the 
whole 
industrial 
chain 
and 
eventually 
create 
a 
complete 
blockchain 
ecosystem, 
which 
is 
conducive 
to 
the 
accurate 
completion 
of 
clinical 
trials.
