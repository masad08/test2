Abstract 

Background: Clinical Trials (CTs) help in testing and validating the safety and efficacy of newly discovered drugs on 
specific patient population cohorts. However, these trials usually experience many challenges, such as extensive 
time frames, high financial cost, regulatory and administrative barriers, and insufficient workforce. In addition, CTs 
face several data management challenges pertaining to protocol compliance, patient enrollment, transparency, 
traceability, data integrity, and selective reporting. Blockchain can potentially address such challenges because of its 
intrinsic features and properties. Although existing literature broadly discusses the applicability of blockchain-based 
solutions for CTs, only a few studies present their working proof-of-concept. 

Methods: We propose a blockchain-based framework for CT data management, using Ethereum smart contracts, 
which employs IPFS as the file storage system to automate processes and information exchange among CT 
stakeholders. CT documents stored in the IPFS are difficult to tamper with as they are given unique cryptographic 
hashes. We present algorithms that capture various stages of CT data management. We develop the Ethereum 
smart contract using Remix IDE that is validated under different scenarios. 

Results: The proposed framework results are advantageous to all stakeholders ensuring transparency, data integrity, 
and protocol compliance. Although the proposed solution is tested on the Ethereum blockchain platform, it can be 
deployed in private blockchain networks using their native smart contract technologies. We make our smart 
contract code publicly available on Github. 

Conclusions: We conclude that the proposed framework can be highly effective in ensuring that the trial abides by 
the protocol and the functions are executed only by the stakeholders who are given permission. It also assures data 
integrity and promotes transparency and traceability of information among stakeholders.

networks, namely, public and private. The former is an 
open-source network that allows anyone to participate 
in the network; whereas, the latter places a restriction on 
who is allowed to enter and participate in the network

enabled its wide adoption in various industries and domains,

[2, 4], AI [5], deepfake videos [6], and the healthcare sector 
[7]. For instance, IBM has shown that 56% of healthcare 
administrators plan on implementing blockchainbased 
solutions by 2020 [8]. Blockchain has significantly 
revolutionized the way Clinical Trial (CT) data is stored, 
transmitted, and managed. Modern CTs face several 
challenges related to huge volume and variety of data 
generated during multiple phases and multi-year studies. 
These include privacy concerns [9, 10], increased expenses 
[11, 12], reproducibility of results [13], patient 
enrollment/recruitment [14], data integrity [15], protocol 
compliance, and data sharing [16]. To tackle these obstacles, 
researchers are compelled to move away from legacy 
clinical database management platforms, such as 
Oracle Clinical software and SigmaSoft’s DMSYS Software 
[17]. Thus, the CT industry has been keen on exploring 
different blockchain platforms, such as 
Hyperledger [18] and Ethereum [19] to provide feasible 
solutions to combat data management issues. 

Blockchain enhances CT research by empowering the 
research community with a secure network of sharing 
data. Typically, blockchain is a distributed ledger with all 
valid transactions stored as a chain of blocks. These 
transactions cannot be stolen, hacked or infringed since 
the data is stored over a decentralized network where 
each node has a copy of the database [8]. The nature of 
the network, verification requirements through cryptographic 
techniques and timestamped records ensure that 
data is immutable and auditable [20, 21]. Hence, it is a 
safe platform for storing sensitive information including 
electronic healthcare records, clinician notes, eprescribing, 
analysis results, and protocol of CT. Ethereum 
is one of the blockchain platforms which runs 
smart contracts. It allows the creation of smart contracts 
using Solidity language. It is a high-level language 
whereby one can develop contracts using various components, 
such as variables, addresses, setters, getters, 
events, and modifiers. Such contracts enable users to 
program different functionalities and build various applications 
and services. The contracts act as smart software 
agents to automatically administer certain transactions 
when preassigned conditions are met in a blockchain 
network [22, 23], which make them suitable for CTs as 
they eliminate the need for third-party interference. In 
the Ethereum smart contract system, initially, each actor 
needs to be registered through a unique Ethereum address 
(EA) that is stored in the Ethereum Wallet. The 
wallet requires a private key, specific to the individual 
actor that enables access to the Ethereum address stored 
in the wallet, which is also the public key. The public 
key from the wallet authorizes access to actors responsible 
to perform certain activities. Any unauthorized 
actor cannot access the smart contracts due to a mismatch 
between private-public key pairs stored in the 

wallet. In this way, the Ethereum user authentication is 
handled or managed. Storing vast amounts of data on 
the blockchain is expensive and energy-draining [24]. 
For data storage, decentralized mechanisms, such as 
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [24] and FileCoin 

[25] are currently being used along with blockchain 
systems whereby stored data is traceable and 
immutable. 
The convergence of blockchain and CTs is still in its 
infancy and as such very limited literature is available on 
this subject. For example, Choudhury et al. [26] have 
proposed a framework that helps to manage and monitor 
data in multi-site CTs. In [27], the authors have developed 
a system named “BlockTrial”, which facilitates 
users to execute trials-related smart contracts on the 
Ethereum network. Such contracts grant researchers access 
to their data and enable them to submit queries for 
data stored on off-chains. The study conducted in [28] 
implements a blockchain-based solution that enables patients 
and stakeholders to manage consent information 
in a manner that is transparent, immutable, traceable, 
and secure. Another study [29] has introduced a framework, 
which helps to deal with the dynamic nature of 
consent management. The authors in [30] proposed a 
blockchain-based framework that aims to enforce Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) regulations (i.e., subject recruitment, 
informed consent management, secondary 
data sharing, monitoring risks, and generating automated 
assessments for continuous review) on data collection. 
In summary, existing literature shows that 
researchers have investigated various blockchain platforms 
for CTs to evaluate their capabilities and limitations. 
However, only a few studies including [31] have 
tailored their work towards creating consensus algorithms 
and possible architectures suitable to meet the 
needs of CTs. Several other studies have highlighted the 
significant problems in CTs that blockchain can potentially 
solve [16, 20]. Such problems include patient privacy 
and enrollment, regulatory approval, and data 
integrity and reproducibility. Leveraging blockchain 
technology for managing CT data can help to stimulate 
innovations and bring major improvements in existing 
CT data management systems. In this paper, we propose 
a blockchain-based solution to address the challenges associated 
with CTs data management. Specifically, the 
paper provides a proof-of-concept design that addresses 
the data management, protocol compliance, data integrity, 
and transparency-related challenges in CTs. This 
paper is significantly extended from preliminary results 
presented in [32]. The main contributions are summarized 
below: 

 
We provide an overview of how blockchain can 
enable effective CT data management processes.

We propose a blockchain-based framework detailing 
the relationship and interaction between various 
stakeholders in a CT process using a smart contract 
and IPFS. 

 
We present algorithms used to define the working 
principles of the proposed blockchain approach in a 
CT data management system. 

 
We test various scenarios of the overall system 
functionalities to validate the practicality of the 
proposed solution. 

 
We present the full implementation details and 
make the smart contract code publicly available on 
Github. 

Methods 

The proposed solution is based on the Ethereum blockchain 
platform to enable effective CT data management. 

System overview and design 

Figure 1 presents a system overview of the CT process. 
This process is explained in twelve steps as shown in 
Fig. 2. The stakeholders in the proposed system can be 
divided into four groups. The clinical trial initiation and 
management are carried out by the trial sponsor; 
whereas, the regulatory authority and ethics committee 
are handled by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and IRB. Other stakeholders involved in the clinical 
site are principal investigator (PI), physician, and 

medical lab scientist. In our system design, a physician is 
responsible to contact with patients and medical lab scientists 
simultaneously to monitor and track the patient’s 
progress. The proposed system architecture places the 
Ethereum smart contract at the center of the model 
where stakeholders can actively interact with the contract 
and one another. By doing so, it aims to 
decentralize data management in CT by potentially eliminating 
the role of Contract Research Organization 
(CRO). In traditional systems, CT data is monitored and 
controlled by the CRO. Thus, the responsibilities of 
the CRO would be ideally transformed into a smart 
contract for automatic execution eliminating any interventions. 
Moreover, smart contract features can 
constantly track and monitor the transactions and 
when they occur through the execution of functions 
and triggering events that would act as alerts notifying 
members. Moreover, protecting the identity of patients 
would be easier as each patient would have an 
encrypted address mapped to their identity where 
their information can be accessed only in two ways. 
Either the patients agree to provide their private keys 
to the designated trial site or the trusted appointed 
physician creates and holds the patients’ keys 
throughout the CT process to monitor their response 
with regards to the drug treatment. In our case, we 
chose the latter alternative as the physician would be 
able to understand the progress of the patient better

and explain it to the respective patient during their 
appointed follow-up visit. This is beneficial as the 
physician is more likely to avoid misinterpreting the 
results compared to the patient. 

As shown in Fig. 1, the framework incorporates IPFS 
technology to store a collection of hashed files that 
could be retrieved anytime when incorporated within 
the blockchain. Files stored on the IPFS network are 
given a unique cryptographic hash which is later used to 
track the corresponding file. This makes IPFS an ideal 
place to store data as files are traceable, immutable and 
timestamped via blockchain. Examples of documents 
that could be stored in the IPFS include but are not limited 
to Investigational New Drug (IND) application, 
protocol, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Case Report 
Forms (CRFs), PI’s resume, patients consent and 
medical history, Serious Adverse Event (SAE), lab tests, 
financial and safety reports and lastly, clinical study closure 
report. IPFS permits users to make valid changes 
during the entire CT life cycle. For example, in a certain 
case, where changes need to be made in the document 
after uploading it to the IPFS, a user can reupload the 
modified version of the document on the IPFS against a 
new hash value that can be subsequently stored on the 
blockchain. In this way, a legitimate change or any 
protocol amendment can be accommodated after 
uploading the document to the IPFS. 


Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows the flow diagram of our 
proposed system, which presents activities occurring in 
sequence or parallel. It should be noted that patients do 
not directly interact with the smart contract. 

Entity relationship diagram 

Figure 3 illustrates the attributes of smart contracts 
along with their functions. In addition, it shows the relationship 
between different stakeholders and smart contracts. 
These relations and metadata are vital in 
implementing smart contracts. 

Furthermore, the relationship between any entity and 
the contract is one-to-one as the stakeholders were assumed 
to be single entities (i.e., FDA, IRB, trial sponsor, 
PI, physician, and medical lab scientist). Also, the CT 
was assumed to be conducted across a single clinical site 
with multiple patients. As a result, only the relationship 
between the physician and patients is one-to-many. 

Sequence diagram 

A sequence diagram shows the interactions between different 
stakeholders while simultaneously showing various 
events that are triggered in the sequence of 
functions that are called within the smart contract. Each 
participant in the network holds an Ethereum Address 
(EA) that enables them to interact with each other by 
calling functions within the smart contract. Figure 4

Fig. 3 Entity-relationship between different stakeholders and smart contracts 


illustrates the sequence flow between different stakeholders 
from the IND application to the final step of 
reporting the results obtained by the CT study. 

Initially, the CT trial sponsor is granted permission to 
apply for an IND approval by executing the function 
INDRequestedBySponsor() where this function would include 
attributes, such as IPFS IND application, trial 
phase intended, expected trial duration, etc. The IPFS 
IND application is nothing but the hashed IND application 
document that is uploaded into the system by the 
trial sponsor where the original file could be retrieved 
through IPFS. When the trial sponsor confirms that the 
application is completed, then the FDA calls the function 
SetINDApproval() where the decision of approval or 
rejection is made. Upon receiving the decision, the event 
INDStageStatus() is triggered which notifies the trial 
sponsor and IRB whether the application is approved or 
rejected. In case of application approval, then the trial 
sponsor calls the function ClinicalInitiationBySponsor() 
where accordingly inputs, such as IPFS clinical protocol 
and IPFS SOP, are uploaded into the smart contract. 

Once this step is completed by the trial sponsor, only 
then the FDA is allowed to interact with the SetClinicalInitiationDecision() 
function and dictate whether the 
protocol has been approved or rejected. This invokes the 
event CTInitiationStageStatus() to notify the trial sponsor, 
PI and IRB that the trial will now be ready to commence 
recruiting patients according to the inclusionexclusion 
criteria. 

Then the physician assigned by PI calls the function 
PatientEnrollment()to upload patient’s EA, hashed medical 
history and informed consent etc. Furthermore, an 
event NewPatientEnrolled() is triggered whenever a new 
patient is registered. It should be noted that the patients 
do not interact with the smart contract. Hence, they are 
passive participants and their communication with the 
physician is via off-chain methods, such as face to face 
appointments. Furthermore, the patients would be distinguished 
by their EA, thereby securing their personal 
identification information. The trial commences only 
when the enrollment is complete. Then the physician 
and medical lab scientist call the function

Fig. 4 Sequential illustration of function calls and events in a blockchain-based CT data management system 


MonitorStage()to record the patient’s weekly or monthly 
visits, the patient’s hashed lab results etc. where this 
process continues until the trial period ends. When a patient 
drops out from the trial, then the physician triggers 
the PatientDroppedOut() event to notify all members in 
the network that this particular patient is no longer participating 
and no further monitoring is needed. At the 
end of the trial, statistical computation and a final closure 
report are required to be uploaded by the trial sponsor 
by calling the ReportAnalysisStage() function. These 
report generations and statistical analyses could be done 
using decentralized applications (DApps) where these 
are applications designed to run on a peer to peer network, 
such as blockchain. DApps have recently gained 
popularity due to distributed ledger technologies, such 
as Ethereum. 

Lastly, the final decision comes from the FDA where 
this decision is made by calling the SetCTDecision() 
function. This decision is then announced when the 
event CTDecisionDisclosure() is triggered. This publicly 

notifies the decision made by the FDA to all the active 
participants in the CT blockchain network. However, 
under the circumstance where an SAE occurs during the 
trial monitoring process, then the PI calls the function 
SetSAEStage() where the IPFS SAE report is uploaded. 
Then the IRB calls the SAEApproval() function to make 
a decision on the SAE that has occurred. The SAEStatus() 
event is triggered to broadcast the decision taken 
by the IRB regarding the continuation of the current 
trial protocol. 

Implementation 

Herein, we discuss the algorithms developed for each 
stage to capture the working principles of our proposed 
solution and accordingly develop the smart contract. 
Figure 5 highlights the main actors that would be able to 
interact with the contract for each stage respectively. 
This work process was designed under the assumption 
that the trial sponsor files an application to conduct only 


Phase I of the trial and hence, patient enrollment occurs 
only once. It could also be expanded to capture phase II 
and III of a CT process such that the contract could enable 
the enrollment stage to occur at the beginning of 
each new phase of the trial accordingly. 
New drug application 
Algorithm 1 describes the initial steps taken by the trial 
sponsor to initiate the CT process. This involves seeking 
approval upon submission of a new drug application. As 
can be seen, the trial sponsor is the only stakeholder 
allowed to file for the request, as the smart contract 
would reject all other unauthorized Ethereum addresses. 
Similarly, the decision can only be made by the FDA. 
Furthermore, it also lists the different set of information 
that is required to be fed into the blockchain as a transaction. 
This includes hashed files that link directly to 
IPFS. 
Clinical trial initiation 
Algorithm 2 demonstrates that upon completion of a 
new drug application the trial sponsor can request 
for a CT initiation. It also demonstrates that the 
only stakeholders allowed to interact with the smart 
contract at this stage are the trial sponsor and FDA 
only. Also, the trial sponsor would be required to 
specify the information, such as the minimum number 
of patients required in the trial, protocol, and 
SOP. 
Patient enrollment 
Algorithm 3 demonstrates that the patient enrollment 
process occurs only when the CT initiation request 
is approved. This algorithm lists the steps that 
would be taken during the enrollment stage of the 
CT. Firstly, only the assigned physician would be 
allowed to enrol the patients according to the inclusion 
criteria. The physician maps each patient’s address 
to respective details, such as medical history 
and informed consent. Then all the members in the 
network are notified whenever a new patient is registered 
into the trial. This stage is completed only 
when the number of patients enrolled meets or 
Fig. 5 CT work process flow 
Omar et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2020) 20:224 Page 7 of 17

exceeds the cutoff number that was earlier stated in 
the CT initiation stage. 
Patient monitoring 
Algorithm 4 explains the monitoring process under normal 
circumstances upon the completion of the enrollment 
stage. The only stakeholders granted permissions 
are the physician and medical lab scientist to enable 
uploading the patient’s lab results, follow-up information 
and CRF upon each visit. This would help the physician 
in keeping track of their progress. Furthermore, if a patient 
were to drop or withdraw their informed consent 
during the trial then all stakeholders in the network 
would be notified and further monitoring of this patient 
would not be permissible. Thus, the data of the dropped 
patient would be available up to the point of when he or 
she was an active participant in the trial. 
SAE occurrence 
Algorithm 5 presents the steps that would be taken 
under the situation in which an SAE occurs during the 
trial conduction. The PI would upload the SAE reporting 
as per the meetings and investigations that would be carried 
between the physician and medical staff. Accordingly, 
the IRB would then decide whether to allow the 
trial to continue or stop the trial to ensure the safety of 
the participating patients. 
Analysis and reporting 
Algorithm 6 shows that after the monitoring stage is 
completed and results analyzed, the trial sponsor submits 
a closure report to the FDA. The FDA then decides 
to either approve the newly tested drug for further investigation 
or discontinue the study. 
The above algorithms were then transformed into 
Ethereum smart contract using a browser-based 
compiler Remix IDE. The getter functions are used 
to retrieve information while setters are used to 
write data. Modifiers restrict the ability of certain 
members in the network to interact with a function. 
Events act as triggered alerts or signals to notify all 
members that a certain action has been taken. It 
should be noted that each member of the network is

Results 

In this section, we explain various test scenarios obtained 
upon the successful compilation of the smart 
contract. The CT process was tested in stages to ensure 
the process runs in smooth and sequential 
order.

Fig. 6 Testing modifiers wherein (a) function executed with no error as a trial sponsor was the assigned actor while in (b) error appears when an 
intended actor is not the FDA 


New drug application 

At this initial stage, the modifiers were tested to ensure 
only the assigned actors are permitted to interact with a 
specific function. It can be seen in Fig. 6a that when the 
function INDRequestedBySponsor() was executed, no 
error was generated where a green tick mark indicated 
that the function was run by the trial sponsor as 
intended. However, in a case where another member in 
the network who is not given permission attempts to 
execute a function then an error is generated. For instance, 
when the function SetINDApproval() is not executed 
by the FDA then a red cross mark appears 
representing that the action cannot be completed as 
shown in Fig. 6b. This verifies that the restrictions imposed 
on each stakeholder at any stage in our proposed 
framework work as expected. Thus, only they would be 
allowed to add data into the network. 

Secondly, the functionalities of events were tested to 
see whether they are triggered when certain actions are 
completed, such as the ending of each CT stage. Figure 7 
shows that an event is prompted when the FDA makes a 
decision on the IND application where in this case the 
FDA rejected the application request. 

Clinical trial initiation 

The CT stages in the framework are expected to run in 
sequential order. Hence, Fig. 8 proves that the CT initiation 
stage does not commence until the IND application 
stage is completed and approved by the FDA. 

Patient enrollment 

Likewise, the enrollment stage would be executed only 
after the CT initiation stage has been approved. Similarly, 
the enrollment stage would get executed only after 
the CT initiation stage has been approved. Additionally, 
an event is instantiated whenever a new patient is enrolled 
in the trial to notify all the stakeholders in the 
network. Figure 9 shows this event where it also displays 
the new patient’s EA which acts as the patient ID. 

The completion of the enrollment stage requires that 
the number of patients enrolled meets or exceeds the 
minimum number stated in the CT initiation stage. This 
was tested by enabling the trial sponsor EA to specify 
five as the minimum number required in the initiation 
stage. However, in the enrollment stage, we made the 
physician EA enrol only four patients and proceed. Figure 
10a shows that the event notifies all members in the 
network that this stage is incomplete. However, when 
the physician enrols one more patient then attempts to 
proceed to the next stage, an event is triggered allowing 
all stakeholders to know that the enrollment stage is 
completed as shown in Fig. 10b. 

Patient monitoring 

This stage was tested by enabling the physician to upload 
Patient B’s vitals for each visit in the “IPFS Patient 
Follow-up and Lab results” hashed documents made to 
be able to track the progress. Figure 11 shows that a 
patient’s details according to the visit number can be

Fig. 8 CT initiation stage cannot occur without the approval of the IND stage shown in (a) while in (b) its successful 


retrieved as the details have been stored as an array of 
data type struct. 

Moreover, this stage was tested in the case where a 
patient drops out of the trial. In such a case then the 
physician interacts with the smart contract and an event 
is triggered notifying the members in the network that 
Patient A with a particular EA has been dropped from 
the trial as shown in Fig. 12. 

Furthermore, it was tested in the scenario where Patient 
A’s EA is inserted in the GetPatientDetails() getter 
function after it gets deleted. It was observed that a patient’s 
trial details are stored up to the point where the 
patient drops out as shown in Fig. 13a. Also, the Count-
Patients() getter function shows the updated number of 
patients who are currently participating in the trial 
where in this case the updated number is four. However, 
the getter function GetPatientInfo(), lists the patient addresses 
that are participants in the trial. Figure 13b 
shows the updated list of patient addresses where it is 

seen that Patient A’s address has been replaced by zero’s 
indicating that this patient is no longer an active participant 
in the trial. 

A patient can no longer be monitored after having 
been removed from the trial and this was tested as the 
physician tried to monitor Patient A by uploading 
follow-up data. However, an event shown in Fig. 14 was 
triggered to notify the members that an attempt to further 
monitor this patient is against the protocol and 
hence, not permissible. 

SAE occurrence 

The smart contract code was tested in the case where 
the SAE occurred, and the PI was reported by interacting 
with the smart contract. Thus, only the IRB has the 
right to decide regarding SAE reporting. The decision is 
announced, thereby triggering an event, as shown in 
Fig. 15, to alert the members on the status of the SAE

met unlike in (b) 


where in this case, we tested the scenario in which the 
IRB rejects it. 

Analysis and reporting 

The code was tested in the case where the “Patient Monitoring” 
stage has been completed successfully. So, the 
trial sponsor uploads the final CT report and the FDA 
makes a decision based on the trial outcomes. Figure 16 
shows the tested case where the FDA approves the final 
CT outcome which consecutively triggers an event 
informing everyone that the trial has been approved. 

Discussion 

The intrinsic properties of blockchain, such as distributed 
ledger, decentralization, anonymity, and immutability 
enable it to be exploited in various use cases ranging 
from supply chain and logistics to healthcare. One viable 
use case in the healthcare industry is CT data management. 
This is because blockchain can address crucial 
challenges, such as data management, protocol compliance 
data integrity, and transparency. The traditional CT 
data management is centralized and operated by a third 
party organization, such as CRO which creates an environment 
where trust is questionable. Moreover, data 
collected through such a system is more likely to be subjected 
to data entry errors and manipulation without being 
detected. Possible data includes, but is not limited 
to, informed consent, site monitoring, data analysis, and 
regulatory compliance. Thus, blockchain would empower 
regulatory authorities, such as the FDA allowing 
it to track clinical sites to see whether they are abiding 
by the submitted protocol. Blockchain has the potential 
to minimize malicious activities, such as selective 

reporting that could be in the form of under-reporting 
inconsistencies between final reporting and planned outcomes 
or non-significant outcomes. Therefore, blockchain 
could reemphasize data integrity as all participants 
are in a distributed network reinforcing transparency 
which in turn would discourage the falsification of data. 
We evaluated our proposed solution against important 
performance criteria, such as data management, protocol 
compliance, data integrity, and transparency. 

Data management 

Clinical data management (CDM) is a crucial element in 
the conduction of a successful clinical trial. Using efficient 
data management systems aid in reducing the time 
required in collecting, cleaning, managing, and verifying 
data that comply with CT protocol and regulatory standards. 
It also involves identifying any missing information 
needed to accelerate the CT management process. 
Thus, having high-quality data would provide sufficient 
data for analysis and statistical quantification. Currently, 
there are various softwares available in the market for 
managing complex and large trials [33]; however, they 
are centralized and rely on third-parties to manage data. 
Our proposed blockchain-based solution can lighten the 
burden on the processes involved in a CT data management 
system. Moreover, every action taken by a stakeholder 
in our framework remains transparent to all 
members involved in the network. In this way, stakeholders 
cannot deny their actions at a later stage. This is 
because every validated transaction made by a stakeholder 
is signed by that particular stakeholder using 
their digital signature, which is directly generated using 
their private key through hashing.

Protocol compliance 

Following guidelines set by regulatory authorities, such 
as the FDA is essential in getting the trial approved. Ensuring 
that these rules are abided by the trial sponsor is 
necessary to protect the wellbeing of the patients involved 
in the trial. In a traditional clinical trial, the FDA 


used to conduct random and sudden visits to the clinical 
sites where these trials are conducted. This process is 
time-consuming, labor-intensive, cumbersome, and expensive. 
Our smart code captures these guidelines as a 
set of rules programmed into the blockchain. The test 
results of our code reveal that it ensures all actors

Fig. 13 Retrieving (a) Patient A details after drop out (b) updated list of patient EAs 


involved in the CT follow a certain sequential procedure 
in which no actor is granted permission to proceed with 
the next stage without completing the prior stage, as 
shown in Fig. 5. For instance, without the clinical protocol 
approved by the FDA, the code does not move to the 
enrollment and monitoring stages of the CT process. 

Another example captured in our code is that without 
patients’ informed consent, their records cannot be updated 
and tracked during the monitoring stage. This ensures 
that the patient’s wellbeing is protected while 
simultaneously abiding by the IRB’s rules and regulations. 
Also, our code is generic enough, which can be

Fig. 15 An event shows that the IRB rejected SAE report 


tailored to accommodate all the rules that would comply 
with the regulatory rules and ethics. Moreover, the design 
of our contract ensures that the trial abides by the 
new protocol in case of an amendment is made into the 
CT protocol. This is necessary for running an efficient 
trial as all stakeholders would be aware of the new 
changes made in the protocol that they must abide by as 
the trial sponsor would re-upload a new document of 
the protocol which could be viewed through the IPFS. It 
should be noted that the nature of blockchain technology 
does not allow deletion of transactions. This is beneficial 
as stakeholders would be able to track and trace 
the changes made in the protocol throughout the CT 
lifetime in the IPFS and blockchain technologies. 

Data integrity 

Data integrity is essential in CTs. This means that CT 
systems must be actively ready to look out for any mistake 
or malicious attempts. Our blockchain-based solution 
ensures that such mistakes or malicious attempts 
do not occur since the recorded data is validated using 
consensus algorithms. Also, the proposed solution ensures 
immutability using a hashing mechanism in which 
all the blocks are linked to each other through hash 
pointers that make it tamper-proof. Blockchain maintains 
all transaction logs that enable CT organizations to 
easily identify and trace back the origin of errors along 
with the person responsible for entering the inaccurate 
information. Hence, stored CT data on blockchain is 
considered as highly trustworthy. 

Transparency 

Lack of CT transparency is a key issue because it hinders 
patients from getting the full picture of a treatment’s 


benefits and risks. In our proposed blockchain-based solution, 
the ledger is distributed among all stakeholders 
in a decentralized manner that minimizes the probability 
of clinical sites to selectively report optimistic results. In 
this way, our proposed solution enables collaboration 
between different clinical sites and stakeholders as all 
transactions can be viewed in real-time. 

Our proposed framework captures the stakeholders 
that would interact with the Ethereum smart contract at 
each stage in the CT process in sequential order. This is 
illustrated in Fig. 2 which is later translated into a sequence 
diagram shown in Fig. 4. The proposed algorithms 
were translated into a smart contract where the 
code was sliced into six stages and chained together 
using if conditions. The functions used at each stage are 
listed in Table 1. This code’s functionality was tested, 
validated, and verified using Remix IDE. The various 
testing scenarios revealed that the code works in a sequential 
order ensuring that one stage does not proceed 
unless the previous stage is completed successfully as 
intended. Also, it verifies that the contract allowed only 
the participants who were permitted to interact with a 
specific function. Furthermore, events acted as an alert 
whenever an activity occurred or was completed, such as 
the enrollment of a new patient, withdrawal of informed 
consent by a trial participant or the drop out of the CT. 
Although the proposed solution is tested on the Ethereum 
blockchain platform, it can be deployed in private 
blockchain networks, i.e., Hyperledger and Quorum, 
using their native smart contract technologies. Also, our 
smart contract code can be extended to monitor multiple 
trial sites with minimal modifications. Hence, we 
can say the proposed solution is generic and can be implemented 
on multiple trial sites or a permissioned or

permissionless blockchain depending on the needs of 
CT organizations. 

Our smart contract code typically addresses the needs 
of a single-arm trial in which a pool of patients is selected 
with a targeted medical condition and given an 
experimental therapy. Subsequently, patients’ responses 
are monitored and tracked over a specific time. The implemented 
smart contract code is generic, which can be 
applied to various types of CT designs. The following 
changes can be made to the proposed smart contract to 
satisfy the needs of different CT designs. 

Placebo-controlled trials 

In a placebo-controlled trial, patients with a targeted disease 
are identified and randomized to two treatments, 
such as active treatment and placebo. Thus, the monitoring 
stage in our contract would have to be modified 
to track the progress of these two groups separately. The 
PatientMonitoring() function would be split into two 
parts, such as ActivePatientMonitoring() and PlaceboPatientMonitoring(). 
The patients enrolled in the Patient-
Enrollment() function would be randomly registered into 
the two monitoring functions using their Ethereum addresses. 
It should be noted that the patients’ personally 
identifiable information would be protected and secured 
as only their addresses would be visible to the stakeholders 
involved in the network. Subsequently, the 
ReportAnalysisStage() function would analyze the results 
obtained from both treatment groups. 

Crossover trials 

In a cross over design, patients are randomized into a sequence 
of treatments that would be sequentially administered 
during the treatment periods to compare 
different treatments. For instance, to compare treatments 
A and B over two periods, patients can be randomly 
divided into two groups in which group 1 
patients are treated in the sequence of A followed by B; 
whereas, group 2 is treated in the sequence of B to A. In 
such a case, our code would divide the monitoring function 
into two periods in which former group of patients 
would be monitored using the Sequence1PatientMonitoring() 
function; whereas, the latter group would be monitored 
through Sequence2PatientMonitoring() function. 

Factorial trials 

In such type of trials, researchers focus on analyzing the 
effect of interventions (alone or combined). For instance, 
researchers might be interested in studying interventions 
of A only, B only, both A and B, and either A or B. In 
these cases, we would have a function designated for 
monitoring each intervention accordingly. Therefore, the 
revised monitoring functions in our smart contract code 
would be as follows: Intervention1PatientMonitoring(), 

Page 16 of 17 

Intervention2PatientMonitoring(), Intervention3Patient-
Monitoring(), and Intervention4PatientMonitoring(), 
respectively. 

Noninferiority trials 

This trial design is similar to the placebo-controlled trial 
where the treatment groups are divided into two categories; 
namely, active treatment and control. Unlike the 
placebo-controlled trial, the control group in this trial is 
not a placebo but an existing effective therapy, therefore, 
it is named as an active control group. Similarly, these 
trials are called active-controlled trials. For such type of 
trials, code would have an ActivePatientMonitoring() 
function and an ActiveControlledPatientMonitoring() 
function. 

Conclusions 

In this paper, a blockchain solution using smart contracts 
has been proposed for managing data and process 
workflow in CTs. It provides a working proof-of-concept 
solution using smart contracts to address the data management, 
protocol compliance, transparency, anddata integrity 
challenges in a CT. This is because smart 
contracts operate autonomously without the intention of 
third parties. Also, it acts as a smart software agent 
making sure all decision points are fulfilled as intended. 
Furthermore, the proposed solution uses IPFS technology 
as a decentralized storage mechanism to store CT 
documents, such as protocol, informed consent, patient’s 
medical history etc. without the need of storing them 
directly in the blockchain. Our implementation shows 
that our framework can be highly effective in ensuring 
that the trial abides by the protocol and the functions 
are executed only by the stakeholders who are given permission. 
It also assures data integrity and promotes 
transparency and traceability of information among 
stakeholders. We also discussed how our code can be 
tailored to meet the needs of multi-site trials and various 
types of trial designs, such as placebo-controlled trials, 
crossover trials, factorial trials, and noninferiority trials. 
For future research, the proposed solution can be extended 
to incorporate Decentralized Applications 
(DApps) into the framework to aid in streamlining the 
interactions among different participants in the CT ecosystem. 
Moreover, our future research aims to deal with 
scalability issues and finding the exact cost of running a 
blockchain system in CTs research.
