INTRODUCTION 


The 
cost 
of 
conducting 
multi-site 
research 
has 
signicantly 
increased 
over 
time, 
with 
$43 
billion 
spent 
in 
the 
US 
in 
20131, 
2. 
A 
signicant 
portion 
of 
this 
cost 
was 
incurred 
by 
site 
monitoring, 
data 
management, 
and 
verication. 
Typically, 
a 
clinical 
trial 
involves 
two 
phases 
of 
amendments 
to 
the 
protocol, 
each 
requiring 
$450,000. 
As 
multi-site 
trials 
are 
expanding 
to 
multiple 
sites 
to 
recruit 
and 
collect 
data 
from 
more 
individuals 
across 
a 
diverse 
population, 
initiation 
of 
such 
studies 
experiences 
a 
delay 
due 
to 
the 
sites’ 
reliance 
on 
its 
own 
institutional 
review 
board 
(IRB) 
for 
ethical 
reviews. 
To 
expedite 
the 
review 
process 
and 
reduce 
the 
administrative 
burden, 
time, 
and 
cost 
of 
redundant 
reviews, 
the 
National 
Institutes 
of 
Health 
(NIH) 
issued 
a 
policy 
requiring 
a 
single 
IRB 
(sIRB) 
in 
NIH-funded 
multi-site 
clinical 
research 
studies3 
. 
Participating 
sites 
will 
still 
be 
responsible 
for 
obtaining 
informed 
consent 
from 
subjects 
prior 
to 
enrollment, 
implementing 
the 
approved 
protocol, 
and 
reporting 
cases 
of 
adverse 
events. 
Data 
verication 
may 
happen 
in 
real 
time 
as 
it 
is 
collected, 
but 
often 
occurs 
through 
Extract-Transfer-Loads, 
where 
problems 
with 
data 
integrity 
from 
a 
site 
are 
not 
detected 
until 
later. 
Moreover, 
once 
a 
study 
protocol 
is 
approved, 
it 
is 
dicult 
to 
track 
the 
activities 
of 
participating 
sites 
and 
ensure 
that 
they 
adhere 
to 
the 
required 
guidelines. 


In 
this 
context, 
it 
is 
more 
relevant 
than 
ever 
to 
design 
a 
secure, 
ecient, 
and 
robust 
infrastructure 
that 
not 
only 
enforces 
the 
regulatory 
obligations 
in 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
research 
study, 
but 
also 
ensures 
an 
elevated 
level 
of 
data 
security 
and 
optimization 
of 
cost. 
To 
address 
the 
above-mentioned 
challenges, 
we 
propose 
the 
design 
of 
a 
novel 
data 
management 
framework 
based 
on 
blockchain 
technology, 
smart 
contracts, 
and 
private 
channels. 
Blockchain, 
particularly 
private 
blockchain 
framework, 
has 
been 
proven 
to 
be 
a 
promising 
solution 
for 
several 
applications 
in 
medical 
and 
healthcare 
research4{6 
. 
Although 
the 
authors 
in7 
proposed 
a 
public, 
cryptocurrency-based 
blockchain 
for 
clinical 
research, 
it 
does 
not 
provide 
a 
practical 
solution 
to 
meet 
regulatory 
obligations, 
where 
only 
known 
parties 
are 
allowed 
to 
submit 
study 
data. 
Further, 
in 
a 
use 
case 
comprising 
interested 
stakeholders, 
the 
need 
for 
cryptocurrencies 
as 
incentives 
is 
extraneous. 
Recent 
literature 
on 
auto-generation 
of 
smart 
contracts 
from 
clinical 
trial 
protocols 
re-instates 
the 
value 
of 
blockchain 
and 
smart 
contracts 
in 
enforcing 
protocol 
guidelines8,

In 
this 
paper, 
we 
present 
a 
novel, 
decentralized 
data 
management 
framework 
based 
on 
a 
private 
blockchain 
with 
private 
channels 
to 
improve 
data 
privacy, 
data 
integrity, 
and 
traceability. 
We 
demonstrate 
how 
to 
build 
a 
blockchain 
network 
comprising 
dierent 
personnel 
in 
a 
multi-site 
study, 
create 
private 
channels 
for 
segregating 
sensitive 
data, 
and 
leverage 
smart 
contracts 
for 
enforcing 
the 
requirements 
of 
a 
study 
protocol. 
We 
evaluate 
the 
eectiveness 
of 
our 
proposed 
framework 
in 
satisfying 
the 
major 
requirements 
of 
NIH-funded 
multi-site 
clinical 
trials10{13: 
eligibility 
criteria 
for

and 
assisting 
in

We 
compare 
and 
contrast 
our 
method 
with 
the 
centralized 
trial 
management 
approach. 
Finally, 
to 
provide 
a 
holistic 
overview 
of 
implementing 
blockchain-based 
solutions 
for 
biomedical 
and 
healthcare 
applications, 
we 
discuss 
the 
challenges 
entailed 
by 
it. 


BACKGROUND 


1.1 
Traditional 
data 
management 
framework 
for 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial 
In 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial, 
the 
trial 
protocol 
must 
be 
followed 
by 
participating 
clinics 
spanning 
across 
multiple 
clinical 
center 
networks. 
Researchers 
conducting 
the 
trial 
at 
multiple 
sites 
maintain 
a 
single 
database 
to 
store 
all 
the 
data 
related 
to 
the 
trial. 
Typically, 
PIs 
and 
other 
clinic 
staff 
use 
a 
webbased 
application 
to 
access 
trial 
information, 
training 
material, 
and 
upload 
collected 
data 
to 
a 
central 
database, 
which 
is 
located 
at 
the 
coordinating 
center. 


In 
a 
traditional 
clinical 
trial 
data 
management 
system, 
when 
a 
subject 
is 
enrolled, 
a 
unique 
identi
cation 
number 
is 
generated 
and 
appended 
to 
the 
corresponding 
entry 
on 
the 
database. 
A 
schedule 
of 
activities 
for 
each 
visit 
is 
generated 
by 
the 
PI. 
The 
web 
application 
has 
a 
tracking 
and 
notication 
system 
which 
can 
advise 
clinic 
staff 
on 
subject 
follow-up 
windows 
and 
required 
laboratory 
activities. 
Tracking 
a 
subject 
begins 
at 
screening 
and 
continues 
throughout 
the 
trial. 
During 
each 
visit, 
data 
is 
collected 
in 
the 
form 
of 
questionnaires, 
samples, 
and 
lab 
results. 
The 
participating 
clinic 
sites 
use 
the 
web 
application 
to 
update 
data 
from 
paper-based 
forms 
and 
questionnaires. 
The 
data 
entry 
system 
is 
designed 
to 
mirror 
the 
forms 
for 
accuracy 
of 
data 
entry. 
This 
is 
linked 
to 
a 
relational 
database 
that 
is 
managed 
by 
the 
coordinating 
center 
at 
a 
central 
location. 
Such 
a 
framework 
is 
prone 
to 
the 
risk 
of 
single 
point 
of 
failure 
(SPOF) 
and 
can 
result 
in 
the 
loss 
of 
data. 


Following 
a 
subject 
visit, 
the 
clinic 
coordinator 
reviews 
the 
required 
forms 
and 
laboratory 
reports 
for 
accuracy 
and 
completeness. 
If 
the 
data 
entered 
by 
the 
clinic 
staff 
is 
overridden, 
it 
is 
agged 
for 
review 
by 
the 
coordinator. 
The 
database 
can 
also 
be 
accessed 
by 
the 
Data 
and 
Safety 
Monitoring 
Board 
(DSMB), 
who 
review 
the 
trial 
and 
cases 
of 
serious 
adverse 
events 
(SAE) 
to 
provide 
recommendations 
for 
continuation 
of 
the 
trial 
and 
clinical 
performance. 
To 
assist 
with 
trial 
monitoring 
and 
quality 
control, 
data 
edit 
reports, 
including 
site 
assessments, 
are 
generated. 
The 
system 
requires 
nightly 
backups 
and 
storage 
of 
backup 
tapes 
in 
a 
locked, 
re-proof 
and 
water-proof 
area 
at 
multiple 
locations 
for 
data 
recovery, 
in 
case 
of 
a 
disaster. 
Such 
manual 
intervention 
for 
data 
management 
and 
maintenance 
increases 
the 
cost 
of 
trial 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
error. 
Moreover, 
the 
data 
recovery 
time 
for 
such 
a 
system 
is 
high, 
which 
impacts 
the 
trial. 
Figure 
1 
illustrates 
the 
traditional 
centralized 
data 
management 
framework 
used 
in 
multi-site 
clinical 
trials. 


1.2 
Blockchain 
technology 
Blockchain 
technology 
has 
been 
perceived 
to 
revolutionize 
several 
domains, 
including 
nance14, 
15, 
healthcare4, 
5, 
16, 
supply 
chain17 
, 
and 
the 
government 
sector18{20 
. 
Blockchain 
is 
a 
decentralized 
ledger 
capable 
of 
maintaining 
an 
immutable 
record 
of 
transactions 
and 
tracking 
assets. 
The 
ledger 
has 
a 
veried 
proof 
of 
transactions 
in 
blocks 
that 
are 
linked 
together 
to 
form 
a 
chain. 
Each 
block 
contains 
a 
hash, 
a 
list 
of 
valid 
transactions, 
and 
a 
hash 
of 
the 
previous 
block, 
attributing 
to 
making 
the 
blockchain 
tamper-proof. 
Although 
Bitcoin14 
was 
the 
rst 
cryptocurrency-based 
implementation 
of 
blockchain, 
many 
blockchain 
frameworks 
with 
varying 
features 
have 
been 
introduced 
over 
the 
last 
decade. 
Based 
on 
the 
underlying 
network, 
blockchains 
can 
be 
categorized 
into 
permissionless 
and

Traditional

and

in 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial. 
Data 
collected 
from 
enrolled 
subjects 
at 
each 
site 
is 
stored 
in 
a 
centralized 
database 
maintained 
by 
the 
coordinating 
center. 
The 
database 
is 
accessible 
to 
the 
IRB, 
DSMB, 
sponsors, 
and 
regulatory 
agency. 
The

data

permissioned 
frameworks. 
A 
permissionless 
blockchain 
supports 
anonymous 
participants 
to 
join 
the 
network 
and 
participate 
in 
consensus 
without 
any 
prior 
approval. 
They 
are 
usually 
driven 
by 
the 
Proof 
of 
Work 
(PoW) 
protocol 
to 
achieve 
consensus. 
Bitcoin 
and 
many 
other 
cryptocurrency-based 
implementations 
are 
based 
on 
such 
permissionless 
or 
public 
network. 
Contrary 
to 
this, 
in 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain, 
only 
an 
interested 
stakeholder 
with 
a 
unique 
private 
identity 
can 
join 
the 
network, 
read 
the 
ledger, 
propose 
transactions, 
and 
participate 
in 
consensus. 
The 
transactions 
can 
be 
veri
ed 
through 
dierent 
consensus 
mechanisms, 
such 
as 
Proof 
of 
Elapsed 
Time 
(PoET)21 
and 
Practical 
Byzantine 
Fault 
Tolerance 
(PBFT)22 
. 
A 
majority 
of 
permissioned 
blockchains 
support 
smart 
contracts 
that 
dene 
a 
set 
of 
rules 
to 
govern 
transactions 
within 
the 
network. 
Smart 
contracts 
are 
computer 
programs 
that 
can 
implement 
functionalities 
to 
enforce 
rules 
dened 
in 
a 
business 
agreement 
and 
be 
executed 
automatically 
as 
part 
of 
invoked 
transactions. 
They 
can 
further 
enforce 
authorized 
data 
sharing 
through 
ne-grained 
access 
control6 
. 


1.3 
Private 
blockchains 
for 
healthcare 
applications 
Private 
blockchain 
is 
fundamental 
in 
most 
industry 
use 
cases, 
such 
as 
nance, 
insurance, 
supply 
chain, 
and 
healthcare. 
A 
majority 
of 
biomedical 
and 
healthcare 
applications 
involve 
interested 
stakeholders 
as 
participants, 
for 
which 
blockchain 
frameworks 
built 
on 
a 
private 
network 
are 
more 
suitable. 
They 
do 
not 
require 
incentives, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
cryptocurrencies, 
for 
participation. 
Some 
of 
the 
more 
popular 
private 
blockchain 
implementations 
include 
Hyperledger23 
, 
Ethereum24 
, 
and 
R3 
Corda25 
. 


In 
healthcare 
applications, 
a 
private 
blockchain 
can 
be 
used 
for 
secure 
data 
collection, 
management, 
and 
sharing. 
For 
instance, 
MedRec5 
, 
a 
decentralized 
data 
management 
system 
based 
on 
Ethereum's 
private 
network, 
can 
share 
electronic 
medical 
records 
between 
patients 
and 
providers. 
The 
authors 
in26 
used 
Ethereum 
for 
secure 
analysis 
and 
management 
of 
medical 
sensors. 
The 
Orange 
Consent 
Management 
System6 
, 
built 
on 
Hyperledger 
Fabric, 
provides 
a 
consent 
management 
system 
for 
users 
to 


3 



share 
their 
health 
data. 
In 
the 
article4 
, 
the 
authors 
used 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
to 
develop 
a 
decentralized 
framework 
for 
consent 
management 
and 
secondary 
use 
of 
research 
data. 
They 
also 
demonstrated 
how 
to 
leverage 
smart 
contracts 
to 
enforce 
IRB 
regulations 
in 
a 
research 
study. 


1.4 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
is 
a 
private 
blockchain 
framework 
developed 
by 
The 
Linux 
Foundation. 
It 
oers 
a 
modular 
architecture 
supporting 
pluggable 
components, 
such 
as 
consensus 
protocol, 
encryption, 
identity 
management, 
and 
membership 
services. 
The 
private 
network 
comprises 
multiple 
nodes, 
a 
smart 
contract 
or 
chaincode, 
and 
a 
ledger 
containing 
a 
state 
database 
and 
a 
log 
of 
transactions. 
A 
node 
can 
be 
maintained 
by 
an 
individual 
or 
multiple 
users. 
Based 
on 
their 
functionalities, 
the 
nodes 
can 
be 
categorized 
into 
client 
(invokes 
transactions), 
peer 
(maintains 
and 
updates 
ledger), 
and 
orderer 
(supports 
communication 
and 
maintains 
order 
of 
transactions). 
This 
is 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
2. 


• 
Client 
node: 
It 
submits 
transaction-invocation 
to 
the 
endorsers 
and 
transaction-proposals 
to 
the 
orderer. 
It 
is 
connected 
to 
both 
peer 
and 
orderer 
nodes. 
• 
Peer 
node: 
It 
commits 
transactions 
and 
maintains 
the 
world 
state 
of 
the 
ledger. 
It 
updates 
the 
ledger 
after 
receiving 
ordered 
states 
from 
the 
orderer. 
A 
peer 
node 
can 
act 
as 
an 
endorser 
to 
sign 
a 
proposed 
transaction 
before 
it 
is 
sent 
to 
the 
orderer. 
• 
Orderer 
node: 
It 
runs 
a 
broadcast 
communication 
service 
to 
guarantee 
delivery. 
It 
delivers 
transactions 
to 
the 
peer 
nodes 
after 
verifying 
the 
endorsement 
message. 
A 
smart 
contract, 
also 
known 
as 
chaincode 
in 
Hyperledger 
Fabric, 
is 
a 
self-executing 
logic 
that 
represents 
agreements 
or 
a 
set 
of 
rules 
which 
govern 
transactions 
in 
a 
blockchain 
network. 
The 
rules 
are 
implemented 
as 
functions 
in 
chaincode. 
All 
data 
transactions 
that 
require 
accessing 
the 
ledger 
invoke 
corresponding 
chaincode 
functions. 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
implements 
endorsement 
policies 
or 
conditions 
to 
validate 
proposed 
transactions. 
Once 
a 
transaction 
is 
proposed 
by 
a 
client, 
it 
must 
be 
endorsed 
by 
the 
pre-dened 
endorsing 
nodes. 
The 
endorsement 
signatures 
are 
collected 
and 
sent 
to 
the 
orderer. 
The 
orderer 
veries 
the 
endorsement 
message, 
such 
as 
valid 
number 
of 
endorser 
signatures 
and 
simulated 
transaction 
results, 
from 
all 
endorsers. 
The 
collected 
transactions 
are 
then 
sent 
as 
a 
new 
block 
to 
all 
peers. 
A 
trusted 
Membership 
Service 
Provider 
(MSP) 
enrolls 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
network. 
MSP 
provides 
a 
veriable 
digital 
identity 
to 
all 
entities 
in 
the 
blockchain 
network, 
such 
as 
peers, 
orderers, 
and 
clients. 
It 
serves 
as 
a 
trusted 
authority 
which 
abstracts 
the 
process 
of 
issuing 
cryptographic 
certicates 
and 
user 
authentication. 
Some 
of 
the 
other 
notable 
features 
of 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
include: 


• 
Condentiality: 
In 
addition 
to 
a 
private 
network, 
it 
allows 
creation 
of 
private 
channels 
comprising 
a 
sub-group 
of 
network 
participants. 
All 
information 
related 
to 
a 
channel 
are 
accessible 
only 
to 
the 
members 
of 
that 
channel, 
thereby 
elevating 
the 
level 
of 
condentiality. 
• 
Cryptographic 
identity 
management: 
A 
membership 
identity 
service 
manages 
user 
IDs 
and 
authenticates 
all 
participants 
on 
the 
network. 
Additional 
access 
control 
can 
be 
implemented 
for 
specic 
network 
operations. 
• 
Modular 
design: 
It 
supports 
a 
modular 
architecture 
that 
allows 
dierent 
components, 
such 
as 
membership 
function 
and 
consensus, 
to 
be 
plug-and-play.

METHODS 


To 
address 
the 
challenges 
experienced 
by 
a 
traditional 
data 
management 
system 
in 
multi-site 
clinical 
trials, 
we 
design 
a 
blockchain-based 
infrastructure 
for 
collecting, 
storing, 
managing, 
and 
sharing 
trial 
data. 
We 
model 
our 
system 
on 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
to 
leverage 
its 
inherent 
features, 
such 
as 
private 
network, 
private 
channels, 
and 
smart 
contract. 
In 
this 
section, 
we 
describe 
the 
design 
of 
our 
proposed 
system: 
setting 
up 
the 
network, 
installing 
private 
channels, 
and 
writing 
channel-specic 
smart 
contracts.

System 
architecture 
of 
Hyperledger 
Fabric. 
The 
private 
network 
consists 
of 
peer 
nodes 
(also 
acting 
as 
client 
and 
endorser 
nodes) 
and 
an 
orderer 
node. 
Peer 
nodes 
1 
and 
3 
belong 
to 
one 
channel 
(shown 
in 
red), 
maintains 
a 
ledger, 
and 
operates 
on 
the 
same 
smart 
contract, 
whereas 
peer 
node 
2 
belong 
to 
a 
dierent 
channel 
(shown 
in 
blue) 
and 
has 
a 
dierent 
ledger 
and 
smart 
contract. 
The 
orderer 
node 
maintains 
the 
order 
of 
proposed 
transactions, 
validates 
endorsement 
signatures, 
and 
broadcasts 
messages 
to 
peers. 


2.1 
Setting 
Up 
a 
Blockchain 
Network 
Prior 
to 
setting 
up 
a 
blockchain 
network, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
identify 
the 
stakeholders 
or 
participants 
and 
their 
roles. 
Based 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
study 
of 
NIH-funded 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial 
protocols10{13 
, 
we 
enlist 
the 
following 
personnel 
to 
be 
most 
important 
in 
conducting 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial: 


• 
Subject 
-An 
individual 
about 
whom 
an 
investigator 
collects 
data 
to 
conduct 
a 
research 
study. 
Data 
can 
be 
collected 
through 
intervention 
or 
interaction 
with 
the 
individual. 
• 
Principal 
Investigator 
(PI) 
-The 
primary 
individual 
responsible 
for 
preparing, 
conducting, 
and 
administering 
the 
study 
at 
each 
site 
of 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial. 
While 
maintaining 
the 
ethical 
conduct 
and 
supervision 
of 
a 
study, 
PIs 
must 
protect 
the 
rights, 
safety, 
and 
welfare 
of 
subjects 
enrolled 
in 
the 
trial. 
They 
have 
access 
to 
the 
data 
and 
specimen 
collected 
from 
subjects, 
results 
of 
analysis, 
cases 
of 
adverse 
events, 
and 
study 
reports. 
• 
Coordinating 
Center 
(CC) 
-A 
center 
that 
is 
responsible 
for 
coordinating 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial. 
They 
generate 
data 
edit 
reports, 
schedule 
of 
activities 
for 
subjects, 
and 
communicate 
them 
to 
appropriate 
stakeholders. 
They 
maintain 
a 
central 
database 
that 
also 
stores 
SAS 
data. 
• 
Data 
Safety 
and 
Monitoring 
Board 
(DSMB) 
-An 
independent 
group 
of 
experts 
that 
periodically 
review 
and 
evaluate 
the 
accumulated 
study 
data 
for 
participant 
safety 
and 
study 
progress, 
make 
recommendations 
concerning 
the 
continuation, 
modication, 
or 
termination 
of 
the 
trial. 
• 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
(IRB) 
-A 
board 
designated 
to 
protect 
the 
rights, 
safety, 
and 
wellbeing 
of 
human 
subjects 
participating 
in 
a 
clinical 
trial. 
They 
review 
all 
aspects 
of 
a 
trial, 
including 
5 



approval 
of 
study 
material 
before 
and 
during 
the 
study. 
The 
new 
policy 
of 
NIH 
requires 
a 
single 
IRB 
(sIRB) 
for 
conducting 
ethical 
review 
of 
multi-site 
studies. 


• 
Regulatory 
agencies 
-Regulatory 
agencies, 
such 
as 
The 
Food 
and 
Drug 
Administration 
(FDA), 
ensure 
medical 
treatments 
are 
safe 
and 
eective 
for 
subjects 
to 
use. 
They 
perform 
inspections 
of 
study 
sites 
to 
protect 
the 
rights 
of 
subjects 
and 
to 
verify 
the 
quality 
and 
integrity 
of 
the 
data. 
• 
Sponsors 
-An 
individual, 
institution, 
or 
organization 
that 
initiate, 
manage, 
and 
fund 
a 
clinical 
trial, 
but 
does 
not 
actually 
conduct 
it. 
• 
Analysts 
-Researchers 
or 
statisticians 
who 
gather, 
review, 
and 
organize 
trial 
results, 
including 
de-identied 
data 
collected 
from 
subjects. 
We 
consider 
each 
personnel 
involved 
in 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial 
to 
be 
a 
node 
in 
the 
blockchain 
network. 
A 
node 
can 
represent 
an 
individual 
(PI), 
an 
agency 
(subject 
agency), 
or 
an 
organization 
(sIRB). 
In 
a 
standard 
blockchain 
network, 
each 
node 
maintains 
a 
single 
ledger 
and 
operates 
on 
a 
smart 
contract. 
The 
smart 
contract 
enforces 
pre-approved 
guidelines 
of 
the 
study 
protocol, 
including 
the 
method 
of 
collecting, 
storing, 
and 
sharing 
trial 
data. 
Raw 
data 
can 
be 
directly 
stored 
on 
the 
ledger. 
However, 
for 
large-scale 
data, 
such 
as 
wearable 
sensor 
readings 
or 
genomic 
data, 
it 
is 
advisable 
to 
store 
it 
o-chain 
with 
an 
encrypted 
key 
linking 
it 
to 
the 
ledger. 


2.2 
Creating 
Private 
Channels 
Hyperledger 
Fabric 
oers 
an 
additional 
level 
of 
data 
privacy 
by 
incorporating 
private 
channels 
between 
subset 
of 
members 
in 
the 
network. 
A 
network 
supports 
multiple 
channels, 
each 
maintaining 
a 
separate 
smart 
contract 
and 
a 
ledger. 
It 
ensures 
condentiality 
by 
making 
all 
data, 
including 
transactions, 
ledger, 
members, 
and 
channel 
information 
invisible 
and 
inaccessible 
to 
any 
member 
not 
explicitly 
granted 
access 
to 
that 
channel. 
These 
light-weight 
channels 
further 
reduce 
the 
storage 
space 
and 
energy 
consumption 
required 
to 
maintain 
a 
blockchain 
network. 
Multiple 
channels 
improve 
transaction 
throughput 
by 
allowing 
transactions 
to 
be 
executed 
in 
parallel27 
. 
For 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial, 
we 
incorporate 
private 
channels 
to 
streamline 
data 
ow 
and 
limit 
data 
access 
to 
designated 
personnel. 
We 
partition 
the 
network 
into 
the 
following 
private 
channels: 


2.2.1 
Subject 
Enrollment 
Channel 
Once 
subjects 
are 
deemed 
eligible 
for 
participation 
in 
a 
clinical 
trial, 
PIs 
collect 
their 
data, 
including 
consent 
and 
protected 
health 
information 
(PHI), 
for 
enrollment. 
This 
channel 
corresponds 
to 
the 
consent 
management 
system 
in 
a 
clinical 
trial. 
To 
ensure 
only 
intended 
members 
in 
the 
blockchain 
network 
have 
access 
to 
such 
sensitive 
data, 
we 
create 
a 
private 
channel 
for 
managing 
enrollment-specic 
information. 
It 
involves 
PIs, 
subjects, 
coordinating 
center, 
and 
DSMB. 
This 
is 
denoted 
by 
the 
blue 
channel 
in 
Figure 
3. 


2.2.2 
Trial 
Monitoring 
Channel 
As 
subjects 
consent 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
study, 
raw 
data 
or 
samples 
are 
collected 
from 
them 
at 
regular 
intervals 
by 
the 
trial 
sites 
or 
clinics. 
We 
create 
a 
separate 
channel, 
involving 
PIs, 
DSMB, 
sponsors, 
coordinating 
center, 
and 
regulatory 
agencies, 
for 
monitoring 
the 
activities 
conducted 
in 
a 
trial. 
The 
members 
of 
this 
channel 
have 
access 
to 
the 
study 
data 
gathered 
from 
subjects, 
activities 
conducted 
on 
each 
visit, 
test 
results, 
and 
cases 
of 
adverse 
events 
experienced 
during 
the 
trial. 
This 
is 
shown 
by 
the 
green 
channel 
in 
Figure 
3. 


2.2.3 
Data 
Analysis 
Channel 
The 
analysts 
conduct 
analyses 
on 
de-identied 
data 
to 
get 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
eectiveness 
of 
the 
study. 
We 
create 
a 
data 
analysis 
channel 
between 
PIs 
and 
analysts 
to 
enable 
secondary 
sharing 
of 
de-identied 
data 
for 
analysis. 
The 
yellow 
channel 
in 
Figure 
3 
depicts 
this.

Figure 
3: 
A 
blockchain-based 
system 
with 
private 
channels 
for 
managing 
data 
in 
a 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial. 
Each 
participant 
maintains 
a 
ledger 
and 
operates 
on 
a 
smart 
contract 
of 
its 
member 
channel. 
It 
maintains 
condentiality 
of 
information 
and 
restricts 
access 
to 
channel 
further 
restrict 
unauthorized 
data 
access 
by 
limiting 
data 
transactions 
to 
channel 
members. 


2.2.4 
Study 
Report 
Channel 
A 
clinical 
study 
report 
is 
a 
detailed 
document 
describing 
the 
methods 
and 
results 
of 
a 
trial. 
It 
integrates 
clinical 
and 
statistical 
description, 
presentations, 
and 
analyses 
results. 
A 
private 
channel, 
comprising 
PIs, 
sponsors, 
regulatory 
agencies, 
coordinating 
center, 
and 
subjects, 
will 
help 
in 
managing 
and 
sharing 
study 
report 
documents. 
This 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
pink 
channel 
in 
Figure 
3. 


Hence, 
in 
this 
framework, 
each 
node 
maintains 
a 
ledger 
corresponding 
to 
each 
of 
its 
member 
channel, 
rather 
than 
a 
single 
ledger 
containing 
the 
entire 
trial 
data. 
Transactions 
within 
each 
channel 
is 
further 
governed 
by 
its 
own 
smart 
contract. 
Although 
our 
proposed 
system 
design 
is 
based 
on 
NIH-funded 
multi-site 
clinical 
trial 
protocols, 
it 
can 
be 
extended 
to 
meet 
specic 
requirements 
of 
other 
studies. 


2.3 
Implementing 
Channel-Specic 
Smart 
Contracts 
Smart 
contracts 
are 
essential 
in 
implementing 
and 
enforcing 
the 
guidelines 
of 
a 
clinical 
trial 
protocol4 
. 
These 
programs 
can 
dene 
a 
list 
of 
functionalities 
incorporating 
specic 
requirements 
for 
conducting 
a 
clinical 
trial. 
Blockchain 
participants 
can 
interact 
with 
an 
application 
interface 
to 
invoke 
the 
functions 
in 
the 
smart 
contract. 
For 
each 
data 
transaction 
request, 
the 
corresponding 
function 
veries 
if 
it 
was 
proposed 
by 
a 
valid 
user 
for 
a 
valid 
channel, 
data 
type, 
and 
time, 
thereby 
allowing 
ne-grained 
access 
control. 
Herein, 
we 
provide 
a 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
smart 
contracts 
specic 
to 
the 
abovementioned 
private 
channels. 


2.3.1 
Smart 
Contract 
for 
Subject 
Enrollment 
Each 
clinical 
trial 
protocol 
denes 
a 
set 
of 
inclusion 
and 
exclusion 
criteria 
that 
determine 
if 
a 
candidate 
is 
eligible 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
study. 
This 
often 
requires 
verifying 
the 
age, 
gender, 
pre-conditions, 
and 
past 
treatment 
of 
the 
candidates. 
An 
enrollment 
function 
within 
the 
smart 
contract 
can 
check 
for 
a 
set 


7 



of 
constraints 
prior 
to 
enrolling 
candidates 
and 
adding 
their 
data 
to 
the 
ledger. 
Since 
PIs 
are 
responsible 
for 
de-identication 
of 
data, 
they 
can 
trigger 
a 
smart 
contract 
functionality 
that 
will 
disassociate 
clinical 
information 
from 
a 
subject's 
identiable 
information. 
While 
enrolling, 
all 
the 
sensitive 
information 
collected 
from 
the 
subjects, 
such 
as 
PHI 
and 
consent 
information, 
can 
be 
stored 
on 
the 
ledger. 
The 
smart 
contract 
can 
further 
check 
if 
intended 
members 
attempt 
to 
invoke 
specic 
functions. 
For 
instance, 
subjects 
can 
attempt 
to 
read 
their 
data 
stored 
by 
the 
PIs 
on 
the 
ledger. 
Similarly, 
members 
of 
DSMB 
can 
have 
read 
or 
write 
access 
to 
this 
ledger. 
Limiting 
access 
of 
such 
sensitive 
information 
to 
designated 
members 
in 
the 
network 
further 
elevates 
data 
privacy. 
Once 
approved, 
the 
subject's 
record 
will 
be 
added 
to 
the 
ledger. 


2.3.2 
Smart 
Contract 
for 
Trial 
Monitoring 
The 
trial 
monitoring 
channel 
collects 
and 
manages 
dierent 
types 
of 
data 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
trial. 
In 
a 
multi-site 
research 
study, 
each 
clinic 
conducts 
a 
given 
set 
of 
activities 
based 
on 
a 
schedule 
of 
activities 
dened 
in 
the 
protocol. 
This 
may 
include 
collecting 
questionnaire 
or 
samples 
from 
subjects, 
running 
laboratory 
tests, 
and 
reporting 
cases 
of 
adverse 
events. 
A 
smart 
contract 
specic 
to 
this 
channel 
can 
verify 
if 
the 
data 
corresponding 
to 
scheduled 
activities 
was 
entered 
into 
the 
system 
during 
an 
approved 
timeline. 
It 
can 
further 
check 
if 
specic 
pre-requirements 
were 
met 
prior 
to 
data 
entry. 
Since 
current 
clinical 
trial 
management 
systems 
often 
experience 
diculty 
in 
reporting 
cases 
of 
adverse 
events 
or 
laboratory 
abnormalities 
in 
a 
timely 
manner, 
smart 
contracts 
can 
be 
leveraged 
to 
record, 
track, 
and 
update 
such 
events 
in 
real-time. 
In 
addition 
to 
expedited 
intervention, 
it 
provides 
a 
transparent 
and 
reliable 
event 
monitoring 
approach 
for 
the 
regulatory 
agency. 
Moreover, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
any 
discrepancy 
or 
attempts 
to 
tamper 
with 
the 
recorded 
data, 
the 
smart 
contract 
will 
ag 
the 
transaction, 
which 
is 
recorded 
in 
the 
immutable 
transaction 
log. 
In 
a 
multi-site 
trial, 
this 
framework 
ensures 
provenance 
and 
quality 
of 
data 
collected 
from 
dierent 
sites. 
The 
implementation 
of 
a 
single 
smart 
contract 
across 
all 
sites 
further 
guarantees 
compliance 
with 
IRB-approved 
study 
protocol 
and 
consistent 
data 
framework. 


2.3.3 
Smart 
Contract 
for 
Data 
Analysis 
The 
de-identied 
data 
collected 
from 
subjects 
are 
shared 
with 
analysts 
for 
secondary 
data 
analysis. 
The 
above-mentioned 
consent 
management 
system 
coupled 
with 
smart 
contract 
limit 
unauthorized 
data 
access, 
even 
for 
the 
least 
restrictive 
blanket 
consent. 
The 
smart 
contract 
checks 
the 
consent 
information 
stored 
on 
the 
ledger 
to 
ensure 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
request. 
Once 
approved, 
de-identied 
data 
in 
SAS 
format 
is 
shared 
with 
them. 
Secondary 
research 
includes 
topics 
like 
longitudinal 
data 
analysis, 
subgroup 
analysis, 
non-linear 
relationships, 
and 
meta-analysis. 
Based 
on 
its 
underlying 
programming 
language, 
a 
smart 
contract 
can 
further 
invoke 
modules 
or 
functionalities 
that 
automatically 
execute 
the 
analysis 
code. 


2.3.4 
Smart 
Contract 
for 
Study 
Report 
A 
clinical 
study 
report 
is 
an 
integrated 
report 
containing 
clinical 
and 
statistical 
description, 
presentations, 
and 
analyses. 
It 
also 
includes 
sample 
case 
report 
forms, 
information 
related 
to 
the 
investigatory 
products, 
technical 
statistical 
documentation, 
patient 
data 
listings, 
and 
technical 
statistical 
details 
such 
as 
derivations, 
computations, 
analyses, 
and 
computer 
output28 
. 
The 
smart 
contract 
designed 
for 
this 
channel 
accesses 
the 
transaction 
log 
to 
automatically 
generate 
audits 
for 
evaluating 
participating 
sites’ 
performance, 
protocol 
adherence, 
and 
ecacy 
of 
the 
trial. 
This 
can 
signicantly 
reduce 
the 
burden 
of 
manual 
audit 
and 
incidents 
of 
selective-reporting, 
under-reporting, 
or 
mis-reporting. 
This 
is 
also 
applicable 
to 
periodic 
generation 
of 
reports 
for 
continuous 
reviews. 
This 
improves 
the 
credibility 
and 
integrity 
of 
the 
study 
report 
submitted 
to 
the 
regulatory 
authority. 


Protocol 
amendments 
occur 
frequently 
in 
clinical 
trials, 
with 
an 
average 
of 
2.3 
amendments 
per 
trial29 
. 
When 
amendments 
are 
unavoidable, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
execute 
and 
track 
the 
amendments 
across 
all 
participating 
sites 
and 
stakeholders. 
Implementing 
such 
amendments 
in 
our 
proposed 
framework 
would 
require 
updating 
the 
channel-specic 
smart 
contracts 
such 
that 
all 
intended 


8 



stakeholders 
are 
aware 
of 
and 
comply 
with 
the 
update. 
This 
is 
achieved 
by 
a 
specialized 
higher 
level 
system 
chaincode, 
that 
incorporates 
and 
tracks 
updates 
made 
to 
the 
channel-specic 
chaincodes. 
For 
transparency, 
prior 
to 
initiating 
an 
update 
for 
a 
smart 
contract, 
an 
endorsement 
policy 
is 
designed 
to 
validate 
it. 


3 
EVALUATION 


We 
evaluate 
the 
eectiveness 
of 
our 
proposed 
data 
management 
system 
in 
enforcing 
the 
major 
requirements 
of 
NIH-funded 
multi-site 
clinical 
trials. 


1. 
Audit 
Trail: 
As 
noted 
by 
the 
National 
Institute 
of 
Drug 
Abuse 
(NIDA) 
in 
its 
guide 
to 
conducting 
high 
quality 
research 
in 
the 
Clinical 
Trials 
Network 
(CTN), 
proper 
documentation 
of 
how 
study 
procedures 
are 
implemented 
is 
necessary 
at 
all 
times30 
. 
Maintaining 
audit 
trail 
involves 
regularly 
monitoring 
study 
sites, 
verifying 
study 
compliance, 
and 
reporting 
on 
monitoring 
visits. 
Since 
current 
systems 
rely 
on 
manual 
eort 
to 
record 
and 
maintain 
documentation, 
they 
experience 
a 
delay 
during 
staff 
turnover 
or 
unplanned 
emergencies. 
Blockchain 
maintains 
an 
immutable 
log 
of 
data 
transactions 
and 
recorded 
activities, 
hence 
eliminating 
the 
need 
for 
paper-based 
trails. 
Any 
attempts 
to 
tamper 
with 
the 
cryptographically 
secure 
transactions 
are 
automatically 
agged 
and 
reported. 
This 
strict 
standard 
for 
study 
oversight 
improves 
traceability 
and 
delity 
of 
the 
research. 
2. 
Data 
Privacy: 
Contrary 
to 
a 
traditional 
system, 
a 
private 
blockchain 
framework 
with 
private 
channels 
oers 
elevated 
data 
privacy. 
As 
discussed 
in4 
, 
blockchain 
and 
smart 
contracts 
enable 
secure 
consent 
management 
and 
secondary 
data 
sharing. 
PIs 
can 
use 
the 
system 
to 
anonymize 
data, 
store 
sensitive 
information 
on 
the 
ledger 
and 
de-identied 
data 
on 
a 
database 
using 
encrypted 
keys. 
Based 
on 
the 
consent 
information 
saved 
on 
the 
ledger, 
third-party 
researchers 
access 
the 
de-identied 
data 
using 
one-time 
encryption 
keys. 
This 
restricts 
them 
from 
accessing 
the 
data 
if 
permissions 
are 
revoked. 
Smart 
contracts 
further 
limit 
unauthorized 
data 
usage 
through 
ne-grained 
access 
control. 
Permission 
for 
data 
access 
can 
be 
granted 
to 
an 
individual 
for 
a 
specic 
data 
type 
and 
duration. 
Private 
channels 
bolster 
data 
privacy 
without 
aecting 
transaction 
eciency. 
A 
recent 
study 
showed 
how 
a 
multi-channel 
setup 
improves 
transaction 
throughput 
by 
allowing 
multiple 
independent 
transactions 
to 
be 
executed 
in 
parallel27 
. 
3. 
Data 
Integrity: 
Data 
provenance 
and 
integrity 
ensure 
the 
validity 
of 
a 
study 
and 
its 
ndings. 
Data 
collection 
and 
reporting 
must 
follow 
an 
approved 
guideline 
and 
standardized 
representation. 
This 
is 
particularly 
relevant 
in 
multi-site 
studies, 
where 
raw 
data, 
questionnaires, 
and 
lab 
reports 
are 
collected 
and 
curated 
by 
multiple 
participating 
sites 
and 
their 
personnel. 
A 
decentralized 
system 
like 
blockchain 
expedites 
data 
entry, 
which 
are 
time-stamped 
and 
nearly 
impossible 
to 
forge 
once 
it 
resides 
on 
the 
system. 
This 
automatically 
enhances 
trust 
in 
the 
system 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
centralized 
trusted 
authority. 
To 
enforce 
data 
integrity 
and 
coherence 
across 
all 
sites, 
smart 
contract 
functions 
dene 
and 
verify 
a 
set 
of 
criteria 
that 
must 
be 
met 
prior 
to 
data 
entry. 
It 
can 
check 
if 
eligibility 
criteria, 
such 
as 
inclusion 
and 
exclusion 
criteria, 
are 
met 
prior 
to 
data 
entry, 
sites 
followed 
a 
schedule 
of 
activities 
on 
each 
visit, 
and 
data 
standards 
like 
HL7 
and 
SNOMED 
CT 
are 
followed. 
This 
reduces 
cases 
of 
data 
fraud 
or 
inconsistency 
that 
are 
usually 
detected 
later 
in 
the 
trial. 
4. 
Protocol 
Violation: 
Protocol 
violations 
decrease 
benet, 
increase 
risk, 
and 
aect 
safety 
and 
welfare 
of 
the 
subjects 
and 
integrity 
of 
the 
data31 
. 
Once 
a 
study 
protocol 
is 
approved, 
using 
the 
current 
trial 
management 
system, 
it 
is 
dicult 
to 
ensure 
all 
sites 
and 
personnel 
adhere 
to 
it. 
A 
smart 
contract 
can 
verify 
if 
certain 
constraints, 
as 
required 
by 
the 
protocol, 
have 
been 
met. 
This 
includes, 
but 
is 
not 
limited 
to, 
inadequate 
informed 
consent, 
subject 
enrollment 
criteria, 
9 



and 
mis-reporting 
or 
under-reporting 
of 
events, 
to 
name 
a 
few. 
Through 
constraint 
checks 
and 
automated 
monitoring, 
smart 
contract 
functions 
detect 
and 
log 
cases 
of 
protocol 
violation. 
It 
further 
assists 
in 
auto-generating 
reports 
to 
notify 
regulatory 
agencies, 
such 
as 
DSMB 
and 
IRB, 
of 
such 
incidents. 
Correct 
and 
timely 
reporting 
of 
protocol 
violations 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
interpretation 
of 
results 
and 
design 
of 
post-approval 
safety 
assessments 
of 
new 
interventions32 
. 


5. 
Protocol 
Amendment: 
Amendments 
to 
a 
clinical 
trial 
protocol 
can 
be 
challenging 
for 
data 
analysis 
and 
interpretation, 
specially 
if 
they 
occur 
part 
way 
through 
the 
trial33 
and 
can 
introduce 
bias 
if 
the 
changes 
are 
made 
based 
on 
the 
trial 
data34, 
35 
. 
The 
implementation 
and 
communication 
of 
amendments 
are 
also 
burdensome 
and 
potentially 
costly36 
. 
Once 
a 
protocol 
is 
amended, 
all 
sites 
must 
adopt 
and 
comply 
with 
the 
updated 
guidelines. 
Smart 
contracts, 
implementing 
protocol 
guidelines, 
are 
updated 
upon 
approval 
from 
appropriate 
members, 
and 
installed 
across 
all 
nodes 
to 
enforce 
the 
updated 
guidelines 
and 
ensure 
consistency. 
If 
an 
amendment 
requires 
updating 
a 
channel-specic 
smart 
contract, 
all 
the 
other 
channels 
can 
still 
operate 
on 
their 
existing 
version. 
Hence, 
our 
framework 
not 
only 
provides 
a 
transparent 
approach 
of 
version 
control, 
but 
also 
a 
modular 
design 
for 
implementing 
amendments. 
6. 
Reporting 
Adverse 
Events: 
To 
fulll 
its 
obligations 
during 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
clinical 
study, 
an 
IRB 
must 
have 
information 
concerning 
unanticipated 
problems 
involving 
risk 
to 
human 
subjects 
in 
the 
study, 
including 
adverse 
events 
that 
are 
considered 
unanticipated 
problems37 
. 
Failure 
to 
report 
or 
delayed 
reporting 
of 
an 
adverse 
event 
can 
have 
serious 
consequences 
on 
a 
subject's 
safety 
and 
welfare, 
study 
results, 
and 
validity 
of 
the 
study. 
Reporting 
a 
case 
of 
adverse 
event 
is 
a 
multi-step 
process 
that 
is 
often 
delayed 
due 
to 
manual 
intervention 
and 
lack 
of 
a 
sophisticated 
approach 
of 
reporting. 
Smart 
contract 
functions, 
triggered 
by 
study 
coordinators, 
PIs, 
or 
aected 
subjects, 
enable 
real-time, 
automated 
reporting 
of 
adverse 
events 
to 
expedite 
intervention. 
These 
functions 
can 
also 
verify 
if 
follow-up 
studies 
for 
assessment 
were 
completed. 
The 
transaction 
log 
can 
be 
accessed 
to 
easily 
track 
and 
monitor 
adverse 
events. 
Such 
an 
approach 
enables 
timely 
identication 
of 
adverse 
events 
and 
responsiveness 
to 
patient 
safety 
concerns.

DISCUSSION 


Multi-site 
clinical 
trials 
entail 
several 
challenges, 
including 
rising 
cost 
and 
lack 
of 
a 
secure, 
systematic 
approach 
for 
data 
management. 
To 
address 
these 
challenges, 
we 
propose 
a 
framework 
based 
on 
a 
permissioned 
blockchain 
that 
supports 
private 
channels 
and 
smart 
contracts. 
We 
partition 
the 
network 
into 
multiple 
channels 
based 
on 
intended 
data 
transactions, 
such 
as 
subject 
enrollment, 
trial 
monitoring, 
data 
analysis, 
and 
study 
report. 
Each 
channel 
comprises 
designated 
stakeholders 
as 
members 
and 
a 
smart 
contract 
enforcing 
data 
transaction 
guidelines. 
Building 
a 
blockchain 
network 
requires 
signicant 
technical 
expertise 
and 
a 
relatively 
higher 
initial 
setup 
cost. 
However, 
it 
oers 
signicant 
advantages 
over 
a 
traditional 
centralized 
system. 
We 
demonstrate 
how 
our 
solution 
satises 
the 
major 
requirements 
of 
NIH-funded 
multi-site 
clinical 
trials: 
audit 
trail, 
data 
privacy, 
data 
integrity, 
detecting 
protocol 
violation, 
protocol 
amendment, 
and 
timely 
reporting 
of 
adverse 
events. 


Although 
researchers 
have 
advocated 
blockchain 
technology 
for 
healthcare 
and 
biomedical 
applications, 
it 
is 
still 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
of 
development. 
Despite 
the 
hype 
revolving 
around 
this 
emerging 
technology, 
one 
must 
discern 
the 
need 
for 
blockchain 
and 
the 
selection 
of 
a 
suitable 
framework 
prior 
to 
its 
adoption38 
. 
The 
translation 
of 
IRB-approved 
guidelines 
to 
smart 
contract 
functionalities 
can 
be 
a 
barrier 
for 
the 
adoption 
of 
this 
technology 
in 
clinical 
trials. 
To 
enable 
seamless 
transition 
of 
protocol 
guidelines 
and 
reproducibility, 
our 
ongoing 
eort 
also 
includes 
developing 
a 
framework 
that 
automatically 
generates 
smart 
contracts 
from 
clinical 
trial 
protocols. 
We 
have 
applied 
machine 
learning 
and 
natural 
language 
processing 
to 
extract 
constraints 
from 
schedule 
of 
activities 
tables 
in 
clinical 
trial 
protocols8 
. 
Through 
a 
human-in-the-loop 
visual 
interface, 
we 
veried 
the 
semantics 
extracted 
from 
the 
tables, 
such 
as 
time 
of 
visit, 
updates 
to 
a 
visit, 
and 
activities 
to 
be 
conducted 
on 
the 
visit. 
As 
shown 
in9 
, 
we 
converted 
the 
extracted 
information 
to 
smart 
contract 
functionalities 
using 
domainspeci
c 
knowledge, 
represented 
as 
ontologies 
and 
semantic 
rules. 
For 
future 
work, 
we 
will 
extend 
our 
blockchain-based 
trial 
management 
system 
such 
that 
regulatory 
agencies 
can 
monitor 
and 
retrieve 
necessary 
information 
without 
the 
burden 
of 
maintaining 
a 
node 
for 
each 
clinical 
trial 
under 
surveillance. 
Finally, 
we 
will 
investigate 
dierent 
incentive 
mechanisms 
for 
active 
participation 
of 
stakeholders, 
particularly 
in 
private 
blockchain 
frameworks 
without 
cryptocurrencies. 
Currently, 
we 
are 
prototyping 
and 
validating 
our 
proposed 
blockchain-based 
data 
management 
framework 
for 
a 
multi-site 
drug 
trial.
