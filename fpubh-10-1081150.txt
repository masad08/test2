Decentralized

are 
studies 
in 
which 
the

is 
reduced 
or 
eliminated. 
The 
CoViD-19 
pandemic 
has 
caused 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
DCT: 
a 
survey 
shows 
that 
76% 
of 
pharmaceutical 
companies,

manufacturers, 
and 
Contract 
Research 
Organizations 
adopted 
decentralized 
techniques 
during 
the 
early 
phase 
of 
the 
pandemic. 
The 
implementation 
of 
DCTs 
relies 
on 
the 
use 
of 
digital

such 
as

or 
to 
local 
healthcare 
settings 
(i.e., 
community-based

The 
feasibility 
and

of 
DCTs 
depends 
on 
several 
requirements 
including 
dedicated

an 
adequate 
regulatory

and 
partnerships 
between

The

of 
Ethics

(ECs) 
is 
crucial 
to 
the 
process 
of

adequate

framework 
are 
needed 
for

by 
ECs. 
DCTs 
also

Introduction 


Decentralized clinical trials1 
(DCTs) make use of 
digital technologies and other methods to enable access 
of patients to clinical research, remote data collection and 
monitoring, and communication between the investigators and 
participating subjects. 

In a DCT, enrolled patients are no longer required to 
frequently travel to a healthcare facility in order to participate 
in the trial, as they are able to take part from their normal living 
environment. The center of gravity of the trial therefore shifts 
from the study site (i.e., the hospital) to the patient’s home. 
Thus, DCTs can adapt to patients’ routines and allow them to 
participate regardless of their geographical position. 

DCTs can include the direct delivery of investigational 
medicinal products (IMP) to participating subjects, laboratory 
examinations and/or instrumental tests carried out in centers 
other than the trial site and close to the patient’s home, and home 
visits by healthcare professionals. This study model typically 
involves use of Internet, smartphones and their applications, 
telemedicine platforms, social media and similar technologies 
at different stages of the trial (patients’ enrolment and consent, 
clinical checks, remote data collection, monitoring and source 
data verification). 

In DCTs, remote data collection can be active or passive. 
When it is active, the patient is required to enter data using 
one or more devices, whereas when it is passive the data are 
logged by the device/s used in the study (e.g., wearables or 
sensors) without active intervention by the patient. In both 
cases, patient involvement in data collection may actually be 
more active than with conventional participation at a healthcare 
facility. Furthermore, by means of electronic instruments, DCTs 
allow constant contact between the patient and research staff. 

DCTs are not an all-or-nothing method, as the 
decentralization can be of varying degrees. The use of 
technology does not exclude personal interaction or the 
possibility of the patient traveling to a healthcare facility and 
participating in the trial under certain circumstances. More 
specifically, a DCT may include procedures that cannot be 
carried out in a home environment. Many DCTs are therefore in 
hybrid form, combining home-based, traditional on-site visits, 
and study procedures. 

DCTs are especially useful in cases that make travel difficult 
for the patient, either for clinical conditions (e.g., neuromuscular 
diseases), or logistical barriers, when research sites are far 
from patient’s home (as often occurs in case of rare diseases). 
Decentralized studies are particularly suitable for low-to 
medium-complexity conditions, and for studies that are not 
excessively long. 

1 
This 
paper 
only 
refers 
to 
DCTs 
on 
medicinal 
products. 


In light of the above, it should be noted that currently, in 
many cases, DCTs do not replace conventional trials. Rather, 
they are supplementary to them. 

The therapeutic areas for which DCTs are most readily 
applicable are those in which telemedicine is most advanced 
like diabetes, neurorehabilitation, cardiovascular diseases, 
pulmonary diseases and, more recently, COVID-19. 

One of the main challenges in the implementation of DCTs 
(in Europe and worldwide) at the current time regards the 
fact that the existing regulatory frameworks were devised with 
conventional clinical trials in mind. Besides, there are still very 
few documents and guidelines on the planning, design and 
evaluation of DCTs and decentralized methods (1), and this 
is in some ways surprising since DCTs are not absolutely a 
novel mode. 

Indeed, the earliest studies on the feasibility of “Internet 
trials” date back to 2003. Since then, there has been a 
continuous crescendo, for example the first “Trial over the 
Internet” was patented in the USA in 2007. In 2011, Pfizer 
conducted the first fully-decentralized randomized study titled 
“Research on Electronic Monitoring of Overactive Bladder 
Treatment Experience, REMOTE” (2, 3), the results of which 
were published in 2014. In this trial, the Internet was used 
for subject enrolment, the administration of online screening 
questionnaires and provision of electronic outcomes diaries, 
and the investigational medicinal product was delivered to the 
patients’ homes. 

Over the last decade, all major pharmaceutical companies 
have conducted DCTs. According to a survey carried out 
by the consulting company McKinsey in December 2019, 
immediately before the pandemic, 38% of representatives of 
the pharmaceutical industry and contract research organizations 
(CROs) anticipated that the majority of their activities would be 
comprised of “virtual” studies and 48% anticipated conducting 
trials in which most of the activities would be carried out at 
patients’ homes. When McKinsey asked the same questions 1 
year later, the answers were 100 and 89%, respectively (4). 

It should therefore be pointed out that the COVID-19 
pandemic has stimulated a considerable increase in DCTs: a 
survey conducted by Oracle (5) showed that, already in the 
1st year of the pandemic, 76% of pharmaceutical companies, 
device manufacturers and CROs had adopted decentralized 
techniques. Of these, 7% used fully decentralized methods. 
Actually, COVID-19 has provided a significant proof of concept 
(PoC) regarding clinical trials in a context of emergency and, in 
particular, on the integration of decentralized approaches. 

In order to support the on-going process, in March 2020 the 
FDA issued in the United States specific operational guidelines 
covering many of the challenges posed by the decentralization 
of activities in clinical studies, with its “Guidance for Industry, 
Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards” (6). 

On 4 February 2021, the European Commission published 
the fourth version of its guidelines on the management of

clinical studies during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. “Guidance 
on the Management of Clinical Trials during the COVID-19 
(Coronavirus) Pandemic.” Despite the temporary nature of 
these guidelines, which were designed for the management of 
clinical trials during the health emergency, they contain key 
information for the implementation of DCTs. Moreover, they 
include the authorization of procedures such as the delivery 
of investigational products at patient’s home, home-based 
visits, use of community-based diagnostic facilities, and remote 
monitoring of collected data / source data verification (7). 
Now the question is whether, which and how those methods 
authorized by the central European and local authorities 
during the emergency will pass from derogation to rule. In 
certain European countries, in recent years, the competent 
institutions have started to deal with the matter starting from 
the local regulatory framework, in order to provide guidance to 
investigators and sponsors (8, 9). 

It is crucial to carry out feasibility studies in order to 
identify the opportunities and the challenges from a regulatory 
standpoint and to favor the authorization and implementation 
of DCTs (10). 

The opportunities appear to be numerous. It has been 
suggested that DCT approaches can be justified and particularly 
suitable for trials with chronic diseases, rare diseases, immobile 
participants, self-administrable IMP, lower safety risk profile, 
and confirmatory clinical trials. Particularly in rare disease 
studies, the changes necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic 
have provided an opportunity to become a standard approach. 
Although some DCT projects were developed even earlier in this 
area, during COVID-19 they forcibly entered clinical practice 
offering advantages in terms of patient burden, practicality, 
inclusion and data quality (11). 

However, not all clinical trials are suitable for 
decentralization and hybrid solutions appear as the more 
reasonable scenario in the very majority of cases. Future 
research will be needed to demonstrate, for example, whether 
studies on DCTs or hybrid DTCs are particularly suitable for 
carrying out prevention or screening studies compared to 
treatment clinical studies. 

The 
risks 
and 
benefits 
of 
DCTs 


The possibility of decentralizing studies affords a number 
of opportunities, with ethical and clinical implications (12–16). 
The potential advantages of DCTs include: 

• 
The possibility of enrolling subjects who are unlikely 
to be able to take part in conventional trials, because 
their home is a long way from a healthcare facility, or 
because of physical difficulties in reaching the facility. 
Facilitated access allows a higher number of patients to 
be eligible for participation. This aspect is particularly 
important, especially in research on rare diseases, because 
it favors inclusion, and improves the representativeness and 
generalisability of the results. 

• 
More convenient conditions for subjects, with less 
avoidable discomfort and suffering, in particular for frail 
subjects. DCTs do away with waiting times, contact with the 
suffering of other patients, in some cases hospitalization, 
possible exposure to pathogens in hospital settings that can 
cause complications. 
• 
Greater autonomy for the participating subject, who can 
remain at home at least for part of the study procedures. 
• 
Greater convenience for families and caregivers. 
• 
The possibility of collecting “real-time” and “realworld 
data,” in the subjects’ usual living environment 
and therefore avoiding potential bias resulting from 
assessments performed in ad 
hoc 
facilities. 
• 
The possibility of evaluating endpoints difficult to measure 
with conventional studies, thanks to the ways in which the 
data can be collected. 
• 
Time-saving. 
• 
Cost-saving. 
Although some studies show an increase in patient retention 
rates in DCTs and better compliance with procedures than in 
conventional trials (due to the home setting, use of electronic 
reminders, an overall less burdensome participation etc.), there 
is no full consensus regarding these aspects in the literature 
(17, 18). 

Nevertheless, despite considering the significant benefits 
decentralized trials can offer, it is also necessary to mention 
disadvantages (some of them may occur in CTs as well). 
Potential barriers, limitations and risks associated with the 
implementation of DCTs (19–24), include: 

• 
Potential amplification of inequalities. Groups with 
reduced access to technologies could be penalized. This 
aspect should be considered both in relation to the ability to 
use devices and the availability of the equipment required 
for connection, i.e., access to a stable connection (which 
may depend on both economic and geographical factors) 
and of supporting devices. 
• 
Partial application (DCTs are not suitable for all 
medical conditions). 
• 
Remote data collection can favor quality, thanks to 
automation of the processes involved. However, the quality 
of collection can be jeopardized as it takes place in a less 
“protected” setting than a research facility. This may lead to 
the risk of technical failures when digital devices are used. 
Therefore, deterioration in data quality at the source and 
during transmission are possible. 
• 
Risks regarding the validity and reliability of the data 
collected. One example is the “6-min walk test” used to 
assess the effects of treatments aimed at improving walking 
Frontiers

capacity in patients with peripheral artery disease. In order 
for the data to be reliable, the test must be performed by 
making the patient walk on a rigid and flat surface, and of 
accurately documented length. However, when the test is 
carried out by a patient at home, it may be troublesome to 
ensure that the surface meets the requirements, is obstaclefree 
and precisely measured (25). This inconsistency could 
have an impact on the reliability of the data. Although 
mistakes and inaccuracy may occur in conventional trials 
as well, factors that may jeopardize validity and reliability 
in DCTs should be properly identified and addressed. 

• 
A methodological bias may arise from the combined 
use of clinical measurements performed in a hospital or 
home setting. A typical example is that of arterial blood 
pressure measurement. 
• 
Some clinical checks may be less accurate if conducted 
remotely. This can lead to potential issues for the wellbeing 
and safety of patients. 
• 
Risks regarding the protection of personal data, also due to 
the increased number of actors involved (e.g., couriers for 
delivery of the investigational product, providers for home 
assistance and digital services, etc). 
• 
Data breach risks. 
• 
Risk of weakening the physician-patient relationship. 
• 
Potential isolation of the trial subject, who does not have 
opportunities to meet and share experiences with other 
patients taking part in the same study. 
Some 
requirements 


Information 
and 
consent 


Given their nature, DCTs often involve the use of e-consent 
of various forms. 

E-consent has advantages over the conventional paper form, 
for example it can be filed easily, retrieved rapidly, updated 
readily and promptly shared amongst the staff involved. Among 
relevant aspects, it is important to ensure that the systems used 
for e-consent have proportionate security levels, and safeguards 
regarding confidentiality are in place. 

Special care must be dedicated to the clarity and 
completeness of the information provided to the patient. 
In the case of fully-digital consent, the validity of the signature 
must be guaranteed from a legal perspective as well. It must 
be borne in mind that electronic signatures, particularly 
Advanced Electronic Signatures (AdESs) require identification 
and registration procedures that could be complicated for some 
subjects: this could hamper, or even preclude, the access of 
certain population groups. 

If the personal relationship with the healthcare professionals 
is important in the information and conventional consent 
procedure, it is even more so in DCTs. Indeed, as DCTs 

are conducted remotely, personal contacts are infrequent (or 
completely absent): it is therefore important to provide chances 
for direct exchange and communication during the initial stage 
and whenever the need arises. In this perspective, face-to-face 
communication should take place between the investigator and 
the potential trial participant. If this discussion takes place in a 
digital / virtual mode, this should be generally performed in real 
time where the parties are able to see and communicate with 
each other via 
audio and video, and to ask questions. 

Access 


DCTs can increase the number of individuals eligible for a 
trial by removing the logistical and geographical barriers but, at 
the same time, they can increase inequalities in access, penalizing 
individuals who do not possess the technologies or the skills 
required. The availability of technologies should not constitute 
an exclusion criterion and the necessary equipment should be 
provided by the sponsor. 

Participants and, if necessary, also their caregivers, should 
be provided not only with initial training on using the 
devices, but also with on-going support throughout the 
progress/evolution/unrolling of the DCT. 

Data 
collected, 
transmitted, 
and 
analyzed 


In general, special care must be taken when applying the 
basic criteria that pertain to all data processing: 

• 
Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. Data must be 
processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in 
relation to the data subject. 
• 
Restriction of the purpose: data must be processed for 
specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. They must 
also be processed in a manner that is compatible with 
such purposes. 
• 
Minimization: personal data must be adequate, relevant 
and restricted to the purposes for which they were collected. 
• 
Accuracy and updating: data must be accurate and upto-
date. There must be procedures in place for the timely 
correction or erasure of inaccurate data. 
• 
Restriction of storage: data must be stored in a form that 
permits the identification of the data subjects only for 
as long as is strictly necessary to fulfill the purposes for 
which they were processed, unless that patient has explicitly 
consented to reuse the data for future research. 
• 
Integrity and confidentiality: personal data must be 
guaranteed adequate security. 
• 
Accountability: the controller must ensure that the data are 
processed in an appropriate manner.

Data must be: Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous (i.e., 
recorded at the time the activities are carried out), Original (or 
true to the original), Accurate (ALCOA) (26). 

In order to allow the reuse of existing data and avoid useless 
duplications, data should also be made Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) (27). 

The accuracy of data recording is particularly important in 
the case of active data collection by the patient. Therefore, the 
subjects taking part in trials must be given adequate instructions 
on this matter. 

There must be commensurate procedures in place to 
ensure the integrity of the data during their transmission and 
management. Special attention must be given to the fact that 
the data stored on personal devices can be easily linked to other 
personal data (contacts, location, microphone, video camera, 
purchases, etc.). Therefore, there must be adequate procedures 
in place to guarantee the effective protection of all personal data. 
The risks of unintentional data disclosure or deliberate breach 
of privacy go well beyond the scope of the DCTs. For example, 
health-related information can result in discrimination in the 
workplace. In order to reduce this kind of risk, it may be useful to 
use distributed ledgers, decentralized databases and blockchain 
technology (28, 29). 

The final use of the data must also be strictly governed: DCTs 
favor the collection of a multitude of real-world data, which 
in some cases go beyond the scope of the study. Therefore, it 
is necessary to prevent their use in contexts other than those 
envisaged by the study. It is also necessary to clearly establish 
which data may be used after the end of the DCT. Patients must 
be adequately informed of this possibility and given the chance 
to grant or refuse their consent to such use. 

Study 
protocol 
flexibility 


Preferences vary from one person to another. For example, 
some may prefer direct personal interactions, without the 
mediation of technology. 

Flexible research programmes can make it possible to not 
overlook differences in personal preferences. To this end, it 
would be useful to give patients the possibility to provide regular 
feedback on their experience regarding the trial. However, 
flexibility may also introduce the risk of methodological biases 
(see what previously reported on arterial blood pressure). 

Provision 
of 
the 
IMP 


In planning a clinical trial, the sponsor and investigator may 
consider whether the IMP is suitable for administration at home, 
and if the appropriate storage conditions of the IMP can be met. 
In DCTs, the medicinal product can be delivered to the subject’s 
home, usually by courier, under supervision and responsibility 
of the pharmacy of the healthcare facility and the investigator. 

In addition to rigorous protection of privacy, the distribution 
system must guarantee quality and efficiency, particularly for 
medicinal products requiring special storage and transportation 
conditions (for instance: maintenance of the cold chain). 

Return 
of 
result 


Patients generally wish to know the results of the clinical 
investigations in which they are involved as soon as possible. In 
DCTs, given the way the studies are conducted, patients may be 
even more eager to find out the results quickly. 

Among other aspects, special attention must be paid to the 
occurring of any incidental findings, in other words, unexpected 
results that are not related to the study and are not intentionally 
sought. In the case of incidental findings that are clinically 
relevant (for prevention and therapy) and actionable, it is 
the physician’s duty not to overlook them: therefore, precise 
procedures must be adopted for the management of any 
incidental findings (30–32). 

Discussion 


The DCT approval process deserves special attention, 
making the role of Ethics Committees (ECs) crucial. 

The procedures for conducting DCTs are such that the 
current regulatory framework may be only partially adequate. 
There are no detailed documents or reference standards 
concerning the role of ECs in the oversight and evaluation 
of DCTs (33). These bodies may encounter difficulties when 
reviewing studies that involve significant complexities due 
to the innovative approaches employed. Information on the 
decentralized activities should therefore be clear and justified 
on a case-by-case basis in the clinical trial protocol (34). In a 
simulated survey on members of European ECs called on to 
review a DCT protocol, it was observed that the quality, safety, 
and organization of the DCT were perceived as being more 
problematic than those of conventional clinical studies. For 
instance, the members expressed concerns regarding the validity 
and accuracy of the data, in case the participating subjects were 
responsible for measuring and inputting them (1). Although 
the criteria used by ECs when analyzing a decentralized clinical 
study are the same as those for conventional studies, the 
application of such criteria to the specific cases can be more 
complex. Moreover, EC members may require supplementary 
information in order to consider, for example, whether the 
procedures for implementing the electronic informed consent 
process are suited to guaranteeing a true personal data 
communication, comprehension, and protection process. 

Aspects examined by ECs when reviewing new studies must 
be considered in the light of the DCTs as well. This scenario 
may be troublesome because of the numerous peculiarities DCTs 
show. One example regards the assessment of site suitability.

DCTs are coordinated by trial sites, whose suitability can be 
assessed using the conventional criteria. However, DCTs are 
conducted at the subjects’ home, which makes it difficult, if not 
impossible, to guarantee a 
priori 
that each home is fully suited to 
the conduct of the DCT in question. 

Another example regards the way in which devices are 
used. Most (but not necessarily all) the devices used in DCTs 
are classified as medical devices. The medical devices must 
be marked pursuant to regulations and used in compliance 
with their intended use. If this were not the case, the DCT 
would qualify as a clinical investigation on a medical device. 
This actually creates a intertwining between the regulations 
governing clinical trials on medicinal products and those on 
medical devices that is often difficult to manage, especially 
for ECs. 

More generally, adequate guidelines, recommendations and 
regulations must be adopted in order to favor harmonization 
of both DCT review and authorization procedures and foster 
virtuous implementation of these trials. 

At European level, an in-depth review of the ethical 
and legal framework is essential for establishing how 
the existing definitions and conceptual rules for clinical 
trials are applicable to the decentralized activities of 
DCTs. As digital technologies gradually become more 
extensively incorporated into clinical trials, the EU 
regulatory framework for DCTs/hybrid trials will have to 
evolve and the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) protocols 
will have to be modernized. Modernizing GCP regulatory 
supervision in order to enable decentralized clinical 
study models is currently an objective for the European 
institutions (35). 

The need for homogeneous safety standards that guarantee 
patients a level of protection not lower than that adopted for 
conventional trials, is particularly important: the fact that DCTs 
can allow real-time continuous monitoring is not, in itself, a 
guarantee of adequate protection. It is also necessary to adopt 
procedures that lead to timely intervention and, preferably, 
provide a remedy in the case of unforeseen circumstances, 
incidents and adverse events. This calls for effective e-health 
systems that are suited to the purpose, and above all a 
health organization that guarantees 24/7 surveillance and 
possible assistance. 

E-health systems must, in any case, offer patients the 
possibility of direct contact with the healthcare facility and with 
the doctors and researchers conducting the trial. With a view 
to this, in many cases, hybrid DCTs are appropriate as they 
alternate procedures at the subject’s home with procedures at the 
trial site. 

Considering the growing number of DCTs and their 
challenging implementation, adequate training -both on the 
technical aspects, including digital skills, and on the ethical 
implications resulting from the decentralized methods -should 
be provided to stakeholders, namely: 

-the healthcare personnel that design and conduct DCTs: all 

of them (including those that carry out home visits) must 

be technically and ethically skilled; 

-the patients and their caregivers, who must be not only 

informed, but also trained; 

-the EC members, so that they can play their responsibility 

for authorizing DCTs with competence and awareness. 

The planning and conduct of DCTs involve particularly complex 
matters: partnerships between sponsors, study sites and patient 
advocacy groups must be favored to promote the best individual 
involvement of the patients themselves. General practitioners 
should also be involved. 

DCTs must be planned and conducted maintaining the 
standards for the production of evidence commonly adopted 
by the scientific community: although for DCTs changes in 
the organizational, administrative, regulatory and operational 
conditions for the conduct are permitted, shortcuts and 
exceptions in the scientific method and rigor are not acceptable. 

Groups that are unlikely to participate in DCTs because of 
digital divide (for example many elderly people) must be offered 
alternative options for trial participation, so that anyone who 
meets the eligibility criteria has the chance to take part. This 
is a major challenge for clinical research in the near future: 
combining and harmonizing the need for equity of access, 
the procedural flexibility offered by the availability of different 
methods of conducting studies, and the methodological rigor in 
the production of reliable scientific evidence. 

Therefore, any decision to switch from a traditional trial 
to DCTs must be decided on a case-by-case basis: the 
elements of decentralization must be justified in relation 
to the characteristics of the study, and balancing improved 
access for patients, their safety, rights and dignity, with the 
quality of collected data. Respect for the person, his/her 
wellbeing and his/her central role must always come first, 
taking precedence over any procedural consideration regarding 
organization, quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and the progress 
of knowledge.
