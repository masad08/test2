Abstract 

Blockchain is a novel data architecture characterized by a chronological sequence 
of blocks in a decentralized manner. We aimed to evaluate the real-world feasibility 
of a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform (METORY) in a decentralized 
and multicenter trial. The study consisted of three visits (i.e., screening and 
2 follow-up visits) with a 2-week interval. Each subject was required to report the 
self-measured body temperatures and take a virtual investigational drug by entering 
the unique drug code on the application. To simulate real-world study settings, 
two major (i.e., changes in the schedule of body temperature measurement) 
and three minor protocol amendments (i.e., nonsignificant changes without any 
changes in the procedures) were set. Overall study completion rates, proportion 
of consent, and response time to each protocol amendment and adherence were 
evaluated. A total of 60 subjects (30 in each center) were enrolled in two study 
centers. All subjects completed the study, and the overall proportion of consent 
to each protocol amendment was 95.7 ± 13.7% (mean ± SD), with a median 
response time of 0.2 h. Overall, subjects took 90.8% ± 19.2% of the total drug, 
whereas compliance with the schedule was 69.1% ± 27.0%. Subjects reported 
96.7% ± 4.2% of the total body temperature measurements whereas the adherence 
to the schedule was 59.0% ± 25.0%, which remarkably decreased after major 
protocol amendments. In conclusion, we evaluated a blockchain-based dynamic 
consent platform in real clinical trial settings. The results suggested that major 
changes should be avoided unless subjects’ proper understanding is warranted.

to the trials. 

INTRODUCTION 

Blockchain, a data architecture characterized by a chronological 
sequence of “blocks,”1 has gained attention as a 
tool to ensure data integrity.2 Especially for clinical trials, 
considerable efforts have been made to guarantee 
data integrity, which is a key objective mandated in Good 
Clinical Practice.3 As blockchain does not allow data to be 
modified or deleted, data recorded on blockchain are not 
only immutable but also traceable.2,4 These characteristics 
are reasons why blockchain can be used in the management 
of clinical trial data.2,4 In addition, a decentralized 
data structure is another key feature of blockchain, providing 
reliable protection from malicious attempts to 
modify data.5 

A recent advent of the dynamic consent concept is 
an important factor that justifies the use of blockchain 
in clinical trials. Dynamic consent is a novel approach 
to allow granular choice of engagement in response to 
changes in the study over time via interactive and personalized 
online interfaces.6,7 As dynamic consent requires a 
time-intensive and transparent process, the immutability 
and traceability of blockchain are highly suitable for the 
concept.7,8 

The introduction of decentralized clinical trials also 
supports using blockchain in clinical trials. Decentralized 
clinical trials are characterized by data collection in an 
extensive environment with little engagement of study 
intermediaries.9 Despite the low-trust environment where 
the data were collected, the concept remarkably gained 
attention after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic.10 Considering the robust data integrity blockchain 
provides, blockchain can be a plausible systematic 
solution for data integrity in decentralized clinical trials. 

Several cases that adopted blockchain in clinical trials 
have been reported. An early attempt to incorporate 
blockchain into clinical trials obtained study consent 
via a Bitcoin-based blockchain network.11 In this prototype 
model, investigators and study participants interacted 
on a web-based consent module that triggered 
blockchain transactions.11 However, as Bitcoin was a 
public blockchain mainly aimed at cryptocurrency,12,13 
the prototype model confronted criticisms in the aspect 
of scalability and efficiency.11 Recent attempts engaged 
next-generation blockchains, such as Ethereum14 or 
Hyperledger fabric,15 which provided improved functionalities 
other than cryptocurrency. Private blockchains 
(e.g., Hyperledger fabric) are recognized as more 
suitable for clinical trials, as they can grant access by 
study centers or personnel.5,16 

In contrast to the current literature given, the actual 
clinical trials that incorporated blockchain in the dynamic 
consent process are relatively few. In addition, several 
concerns that were raised for dynamic consent are notable. 
One concern is that the information conveyed by investigators 
is not always appropriately understood by the 
study participants.17 Another concern is the accessibility 
of the digital interface, particularly for vulnerable populations 
(e.g., elderly individuals).17,18 The patients’ burden 
of making decisions over time is also a significant con


17

cern. For the successful establishment of blockchainbased 
consent frameworks, real-world evaluation needs to 
be conducted. 

To implement a blockchain-based dynamic consent 
framework, we developed a platform named METORY. 
In this study, we evaluated the real-world feasibility of 
METORY by conducting a decentralized and multicenter 
clinical trial using virtual drugs. 


METHODS 

Study subjects 

Adults who were able to use web and smart applications 
were eligible for the study. Subjects with cognitive impairment 
that could hamper the use of the application were 
excluded. Subjects should also be able to report the selfmeasured 
body temperatures via the application and understand 
the instructions from the investigators delivered 
via the application. 

Study design 

The study was conducted for 4 weeks. The study consisted 
of three visits (i.e., screening and 2 follow-up visits) with 
a 2-week interval (Figure 1a). Subjects installed the application 
and were given instructions on using the application 
at the screening visit. At each follow-up visit, subjects 
completed the questionnaires on their user experience 
with the application. All other study procedures were selfconducted 
in home-based settings. 

Each subject was required to report the self-measured 
body temperatures and take a virtual investigational drug 
for COVID-19 daily on the application. Each virtual investigational 
drug consisted of a subject number, study 
schedule, and a drug code with a unique four-digit figure 
(Figure 1b). Entering the drug code on the application was 
regarded as taking the drug, and the time of administration 
was recorded on the application. Subjects were scheduled 
to take the investigational drug in the morning with 
a 4-hour window period (i.e., 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.). Subjects 
and investigators interacted using the chatting system in 
the application during the study period (Figure 1c and 
Table S1). 

The study was approved by the institutional review 
board of Seoul National University Hospital and Jeonbuk 
National University Hospital and was conducted in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki (ClinicalTrials.gov 
registration no. NCT05047016). 

Study scenarios 

To simulate the real-world study settings, two major 
and three minor protocol amendments were scheduled 
during the entire study period. Subjects could be enrolled 
during the entire study period and followed the 
study protocol at the time of enrollment (Figure 1d and 
Table S1). The major protocol amendments involved 
changes in the procedure schedule and were noted as 

changes in the integer part of the protocol version (e.g., 
versions 2.1 to 3.0). The minor protocol amendments 
were changes not related to study design or procedures 
(e.g., correction of typos). 

In addition, to simulate real-world dropout events 
due to serious adverse events, four out of 30 subjects 
in each study center were randomly notified of study 
discontinuation. When dropout was determined, the 
subject discontinued taking virtual drugs (entering the 
drug code on the application) from the time of dropout. 
Other study schedules were maintained as originally 
planned (i.e., self-measurement of body temperature 
and follow-up visits). 

Blockchain-based dynamic consent 
platform 

The platform incorporated a web and application-based 
user interface where subjects could give consent. We 
developed a separate user interface for the subjects and 
the investigators to maximize the convenience of the 
consent process. Each subject accessed the web or application 
and made a user account after the authentication 
process. The verified user was then given access to 
the platform. 

When a subject and an investigator signed on an informed 
consent form, consent-related information was 
integrated in the study management part of the system. 
The information was then sent to the decentralized application 
(dAPP), which was the only component that 
mediated the study management part and the blockchain 
part. The dAPP could write the consent-related information 
onto the blockchain part after the validation process 
in the blockchain part. The dAPP could also could fetch 
the consent-related information from the blockchain part 
requested by the user. 

The blockchain part was developed using Hyperledger 
Fabric, an enterprise-grade private blockchain framework.
19 Hyperledger Fabric was selected as it could not 
only ensure integrity of data but also enable an efficient 
center-level authorization management. Newly added data 
in the blockchain architecture could be only appended to 
form a “chain” structure, which guaranteed immutability. 
Data must be validated by the participating peers in the 
blockchain prior to appendage, which was called the “consensus” 
process. The consensus process was mediated by 
the “platform orderer nodes.” The nodes also performed 
certification and access management process for each 
user. Comprehensively, restricted access of the credible accounts 
and immutability endorsed the implementation of 
the private blockchain architecture (Figure S1).

Assessment of the response to study 
consent and adherence 

The count and proportion of consent to the total encountered 
protocol amendments were calculated. Study 
completion rates were evaluated excluding scheduled 
dropout due to serious adverse events. Response time 
was calculated as the difference between protocol 
amendment and when subjects signed the amended 
consent form. 

Adherence evaluation comprised drug adherence (adherence 
related to drug administration) and procedural 
adherence (adherence related to body temperature measurement). 
Drug adherence consisted of administration of 
the right drug and adherence to the drug administration 
schedule. Procedural adherence comprised whether the 
body temperature was measured and adherence to the procedural 
schedule. 

Statistical analysis 

The sample size was not formally estimated given the 
exploratory nature of the study. Continuous variables 
are summarized as the mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. Count data were summarized 
as the mean and standard deviation of the 
proportions in each subject and overall count of a specific 
event to the total counts. R version 4.1.0 (R Core 

Team, Vienna, Austria) was used for visualization and 
statistical analyses. 

RESULTS 

Subject disposition and response to consent 

A total of 60 subjects (30 subjects for each center) were 
enrolled, and all subjects completed the study. The overall 
proportion of consent to each protocol amendment was 
95.7 ± 13.2% (presented as the mean ± standard deviation). 
The median response time to each amendment was 
0.2 h (Table 1). The entire response to consent of each subject 
is presented in Figure 2. 

Study adherence 

Overall, the subjects took 90.8% ± 19.2% of the total drug 
amount (Table 1, Figure 3), whereas adherence to the 
schedule was 69.1 ± 27.0% (Table 1, Figure 4). Similarly, 
subjects reported 97.6 ± 4.9% of the total body temperature 
measurements (Table 1, Figure 5), whereas adherence to 
the schedule was 59.0% ± 25.0% (Table 1, Figure 6). In 
both centers, adherence to the procedural schedule remarkably 
decreased after the major protocol amendment 
(i.e., study protocol versions 1.1 to 2.0) where procedural 
schedules were changed (Figure 6).

dynamic consent is often questioned. One concern is 
that subjects are exposed to “unwanted information,” 
which could be a large burden when participating in 
a study.20,21 Another concern is that accessing information 
via the web or through an application can be 
challenging for several vulnerable patient groups (e.g., 
elderly).22 
The results of our study revealed that the information 
given on the online platform could often be ignored or 
misunderstood. We noted that many subjects gave consent 
to the amended study protocols without an accurate 
understanding of the content. Most subjects in center 
1 stuck to the initial procedure (i.e., body temperature 
measurement in the morning). A similar phenomenon

was noted in center 2. In addition, several subjects in 
center 2 confused changes in body temperature measurement 
with those in drug administration. This resulted 
in unintended protocol deviations in the drug 
schedule, which could be a highly risky situation in real 
clinical trial settings. 
The protocol deviations strongly suggested that 
the system to verify the accurate understanding of the 
subjects is required. We found that compliance with 
the study procedures was high at the beginning of the 
study, when the investigators directly gave instructions 
on the study procedures. The compliance dramatically

decreased after the notification of the protocol amendment 
via the application. This implied that several 
systemic components that can aid efficient online communication 
are necessary. Such components include

monitoring,25,26 the accurate tracking of drug behavior is 
important. The virtual drugs enabled tracking drug adherence 
with little cost and risk. This approach can be applied 
to further research, such as remote delivery of the 
medication.27 
We also showed the practicality of blockchain-based 
platforms to ensure data integrity in decentralized settings.

subjects and investigators. All consent information and 
procedures were tracked through the blockchain platform

and free from tampering. Utilization of the private blockchain 
made it possible to provide separate authorization 
by centers and personnel. 

Our study had some limitations. The virtual drugs could 
not accurately reflect the events after administering the actual 
drugs, especially for adverse events. The absence of comparators 
(i.e., paper-based consent) also restricted the interpretation 
of the results. Notwithstanding, our study was able to 
demonstrate the real-world feasibility of a blockchain-based 
dynamic consent platform with quantitative outcomes. 

In conclusion, we evaluated a blockchain-based dynamic 
consent platform in real clinical trial settings. The 
results suggested that major changes should be avoided 
unless subjects’ proper understanding is warranted.
